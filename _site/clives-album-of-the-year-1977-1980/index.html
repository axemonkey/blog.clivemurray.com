<p>On we go, come on come on, keep up, I haven't got all day, you know.</p>
<h1>1980</h1>
<h2>Honourable mention</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.van-halen.com/">Van Halen</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Women-Children-First-Remastered-Halen/dp/B00UZTTHTG/">Women and Children First</a></h3>
<p>When <em>Van Halen</em> burst onto the scene they undeniably took it apart (more on that later), and they were still pretty much at the top of their game by the third album. Punchy. <strong>Top track</strong>: &quot;Everybody Wants Some!!&quot;</p>
<h2>Winner</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.acdc.com/">AC/DC</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Back-Black-AC-DC/dp/B00O6YCV80/">Back in Black</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2018/01/bib-300.jpg" alt="AC/DC - Back in Black"></p>
<p>Well. I know I'm going to get into trouble in some quarters, but for me <em>AC/DC</em> has a Geordie singer with a flat cap. I know, I know, and all you O.G. Bon Scott loving fans can go right ahead and tell me how wrong I am, but I'll just smile and stick this album on again. Of course it's a tragedy how BS died, of course he was taken too early, naturally he was a huge part of how the band achieved their success to begin with. I'm not arguing with any of that. But for me, this is THE <em>AC/DC</em> album, and no amount of &quot;Beating Around the Bush&quot;, &quot;Big Balls&quot; or &quot;TNT&quot; is going to change that.</p>
<p><strong>Top tracks:</strong> &quot;Hells Bells&quot;, &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;, &quot;Back in Black&quot;</p>
<h1>1979</h1>
<h2>Honourable mentions</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.acdc.com/">AC/DC</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Highway-Hell-AC-DC/dp/B00O71X5YG/">Highway to Hell</a></h3>
<p>Now that's not to say that I don't like Bon Scott, by the way… I just prefer Johnson. But on this, Scott's final album, he was pretty damned amazing and Angus is absolutely out of control. <strong>Top track</strong>: &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.van-halen.com/">Van Halen</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Van-Halen-II/dp/B00UZTWEVO/">Van Halen II</a></h3>
<p>Ah, <em>Van Halen</em>, you say? Well yes. Their second album has some crackers on it, and the musical pyrotechnics of EVH are if anything a little more harnessed than on the debut. Just a little filler here, but mostly killer. <strong>Top track</strong>: &quot;Light Up the Sky&quot;</p>
<h2>Winner</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.pinkfloyd.com/">Pink Floyd</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wall-2011-Remastered-Version/dp/B005NNYL54/">The Wall</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2018/01/wall-300.jpg" alt="Pink Floyd - The Wall"></p>
<p>So you thought you might like to go to the show?</p>
<p>If you're going to concept album, this is how you do it. (I'm looking at you, <em>Dream Theater</em>.) An introvert odyssey into isolation and what boils down to PTSD and depression, this 81-minute cheery tale of one young man's breakdown and consequent regression inside himself is a prog masterpiece, one of the few of the era that I can actually tolerate, laden as it is with drama and melody from the get-go. Total boner-fido classic, and the only example that comes to mind of a justifiable double album. Go on, name <em>one</em> other (discounting live albums and soundtracks) that wouldn't be better boiled down to a single album… You can't. But this is worth every second.</p>
<p><strong>Top tracks:</strong> &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot;, &quot;Another Brick in the Wall pt. 2&quot;</p>
<h1>1978</h1>
<h2>Honourable mentions</h2>
<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dire_Straits">Dire Straits</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dire-Straits-Remastered/dp/B001KVLPMK/">Dire Straits</a></h3>
<p>This may in fact be my favourite <em>Dire Straits</em> album. There's a prowling moodiness to the lyrics and Mark Knopfler's lead guitar crackles throughout. &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; indeed. <strong>Top track</strong>: &quot;Down to the Waterline&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.brian-eno.net/">Brian Eno</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ambient-Music-Airports-Brian-Eno/dp/B001I3DUQO/">Ambient 1: Music for Airports</a></h3>
<p>Ambient music is not for everyone, but if it is even mildly your bag then you need this. High water mark. <strong>Top track</strong>: &quot;1/1&quot;</p>
<h2>Winner</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.van-halen.com/">Van Halen</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Van-Halen/dp/B00UZTL04Q/">Van Halen</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2018/01/Van_Halen_300.jpg" alt="Van Halen - Van Halen"></p>
<p>Are you kidding me? I frequently wax lyrical about the greatest debut album of all time being <strong>Appetite For Destruction</strong> in 1987, which it is, but this has to be right behind it.</p>
<p>I can't imagine being the rock music industry when this thing hit it. I imagine it must have had to go and have a bit of a lie down.</p>
<p><strong>Top tracks:</strong> &quot;Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love&quot;, &quot;Atomic Punk&quot;, &quot;Runnin' With the Devil&quot;</p>
<h1>1977</h1>
<h2>Dishonourable mention</h2>
<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Pistols">The Sex Pistols</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Never-Mind-Bollocks-Heres-Pistols/dp/B00860FD9O/">Never Mind the Bollocks…</a></h3>
<p>I was never into punk, not even a little bit, but it definitely happened, of that much we can be sure. It transpires that this is actually pretty good, even now. <strong>Top track</strong>: &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot;</p>
<h2>Winner</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.fleetwoodmac.com/">Fleetwood Mac</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rumours-Fleetwood-Mac/dp/B00AI3UW2K/">Rumours</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2018/01/rsz_rumours.jpg" alt="Fleetwood Mac - Rumours"></p>
<p>Retroactively, for sure, though many of the <em>Mac</em> tracks I grew up loving seem to have come from this album, so why not? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumours_(album)">Wikipedia tells me</a> that following the previous eponymous album the band's two couples – Christine &amp; John McVie and Buckingham/Nicks – had split up (as well as drummer Mick Fleetwood going through a divorce of his own), lending a certain frisson to the writing process for this, later claimed to be their most important album of all time (and the band's 11th overall).</p>
<p>Whether you have any time for <em>Fleetwood Mac</em> or not, they were one of the bigger bands of this era and I grew up with many of these songs on the radio, and I still love them. So there.</p>
<p><strong>Top tracks</strong>: &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, &quot;The Chain&quot;</p>
