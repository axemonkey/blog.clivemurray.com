<p>In 2003, the US Department of Homeland Security was established, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster">Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated on re-entry</a>, SARS happened, Apple released <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther">OSX Panther</a>, I got a job at the then fledgling <a href="http://www.thisisdare.com">Dare Digital</a> and using mobile phones while driving was outlawed in the UK, though you wouldn't know it.</p>
<p>Among many others we lost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Gibb">Maurice Gibb</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Simone">Nina Simone</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Redding">Noel Redding</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_White">Barry White</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hope">Bob Hope</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash">Johnny Cash</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Palmer_(singer)">Robert Palmer</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Monkhouse">Bob Monkhouse</a>.</p>
<p>2003 was also the International Year of Fresh Water, and the first year that really felt like rock music wasn't dead after all for about a decade, thus marking the end of <a href="/the-dark-times/">The Dark Times</a>.</p>
<h2>Honourable mentions</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.backyardbabies.com/">Backyard Babies</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stockholm-Syndrome-Backyard-Babies/dp/B0000TAPM4/">Stockholm Syndrome</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/backyard-babies_stockholm-syndrome.jpg" alt="Backyard Babies – Stockholm Syndrome"> These Swedish glam/sleazesters really know their way around a riff. Cracking stuff packed with attitude. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;A Song For The Outcast&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.larrycarlton.com/">Larry Carlton</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sapphire-Blue-Larry-Carlton/dp/B00012FX54/">Sapphire Blue</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/larry-carlton_sapphire-blue.jpg" alt="Larry Carlton – Sapphire Blue"> I went to see Larry play at the Camden Jazz Cafe with a couple of guitar playing buddies, and was wowed. Bought the CD that night, I think. But is it blues-tinged jazz or jazz-tinged blues? <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Night Sweats&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://elbow.co.uk/">Elbow</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cast-Thousands-Elbow/dp/B00009NQZC/">Cast of Thousands</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/elbow_cast-of-thousands.jpg" alt="Elbow – Cast of Thousands"> I was late to the <em>Elbow</em> party, but since discovering them they've become one of my favourite bands of all time, and this is my favourite album of theirs. Just wonderful. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Fugitive Motel&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.evanescence.com/">Evanescence</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fallen-Evanescence/dp/B00019GG1M/">Fallen</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/evanescence_fallen.jpg" alt="Evanescence – Fallen"> If you don't love Amy Lee's voice, you might be doing it wrong. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.skidrow.com/">Skid Row</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thickskin-Skid-Row/dp/B0000AP6KG/">Thickskin</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/skid-row_thickskin.jpg" alt="Skid Row – Thickskin"> A reformed <em>Skid Row</em> without Sebastian Bach was always going to be a bit of a tricky proposition, but I think this album really works. The one after is pretty bad, but this one's fab. Just skip the horrible, unnecessary punk reworking of &quot;I Remember You&quot;. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Born A Beggar&quot;</p>
<h2>And the winner is…</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.theactualdarkness.com">The Darkness</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Permission-Land-Darkness/dp/B0000A0C4U/">Permission To Land</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/the-darkness_permission-to-land.jpeg" alt="The Darkness - Permission To Land">
Absolutely! You couldn't move in 2003 for stripey spandex catsuits, and Justin climbing up on Jools' piano to play a solo during their first appearance on Later is something I'll remember for a while.</p>
<p>The thing is, it's not just a joke - the songs are incredibly well written, especially the lyrics. Yes there is humour involved, but under that there is a damned fine rock band playing great rock songs. And Justin has a knack for writing a song that initially seems to be about one thing but when you actually stop and listen to what he's saying, it's totally something else.</p>
<p>Plus, the album and the band really were absolutely <em>everywhere</em> in the Summer of 2003, and that woke the general populace up to the return of Rock.</p>
<p><strong>Top tracks:</strong> &quot;Growing On Me&quot;, &quot;Get Your Hands Off My Woman&quot;, &quot;Love Is Only A Feeling&quot;</p>
<h2>Turkey of the Year</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.thecoral.co.uk/">The Coral</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Magic-Medicine-Coral/dp/B0000A0UB1/">Magic And Medicine</a></h3>
<p>I loved the first <em>Coral</em> album, but this one was balls. Balls, I tell you.</p>
