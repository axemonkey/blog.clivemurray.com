	<p>This blog is, and always will be, 100% AI-content-free. I don’t just write every single word myself, I actually open up the hard drive of my computer and shout the 0s and 1s onto it. I have been doing this, by hand, since 1998.</p>
  <p>If that’s something you can get behind, and if you enjoy reading this blog and want to support it, you’re welcome to buy me a coffee. Thank you. I really appreciate it. 🙏</p>
