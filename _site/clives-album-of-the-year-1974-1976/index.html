<p>The final part. The end, or I suppose, the beginning. Back to 1974, the year of my birth. The best release of 1974 was clearly me and frankly I only get better every year, but musically…</p>
<h1>1976</h1>
<h2>Winner</h2>
<h3><a href="https://jeanmicheljarre.com/">Jean-Michel Jarre</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Oxyg%C3%A8ne-Jean-Michel-Jarre/dp/B013J553W2/">Oxygene</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2018/01/Oxygene_album_cover-300.jpg" alt="Jean-Michel Jarre - Oxygene"></p>
<p>One of the few artists I got into when I was young (not in 1976, obviously) and before I was gripped by the majesty of rock (and the mystery of roll) was <em>J-MJ</em>. I like pretty much all his stuff and always have. <strong>Oxygene</strong> was probably my favourite of his, and &quot;Oxygene 4&quot; was used on the TV in the 70s and 80s all over the place. Still listen to this now and still love it.</p>
<p><strong>Top tracks</strong>: The whole thing, really, but if you have to pick one out, it's &quot;Oxygene 4&quot;</p>
<h1>1975</h1>
<h2>Honourable mentions</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.ledzeppelin.com/">Led Zeppelin</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Physical-Graffiti-Led-Zeppelin/dp/B00RUT3D5S/">Physical Graffitti</a></h3>
<p>Remember &quot;the double album rule&quot;? Well, this is not another exception I'm afraid – there's a bunch of filler on here, as <em>Zep</em> slid inexorably into the Valley of Diminishing Returns after <strong>Houses of the Holy</strong>, but when it's good it's very very good. <strong>Top track</strong>: &quot;Kashmir&quot;, as well you know.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.queenonline.com/">Queen</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Night-At-Opera-2011-Remaster/dp/B004M17ITY/">A Night at the Opera</a></h3>
<p>Early <em>Queen</em> is a mixed bag, but this one gave us lifelong classics &quot;You're My Best Friend&quot; and &quot;Love of My Life&quot; as well as overlooked gems like &quot;Death on Two Legs&quot; and &quot;'39&quot;, and that's before you even get to track 11, a little ditty called &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; of which you may have heard. <strong>Top track</strong>: &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, like, duh.</p>
<h2>Winner</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.pinkfloyd.com/">Pink Floyd</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wall-2011-Remastered-Version/dp/B005NNYL54/">Wish You Were Here</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2018/01/pw-wish-300.jpg" alt="Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here"></p>
<p>Worth the price of admission several times over for the title track alone, <strong>Wish You Were Here</strong> is just great. It's great. That's what it is, great. Stick it on. It's great.</p>
<p><strong>Top tracks:</strong> &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Have a Cigar&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;</p>
<h1>1974</h1>
<h2>Honourable mention</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.deeppurple.com/">Deep Purple</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Burn-Deep-Purple/dp/B0007ZEO4G/">Burn</a></h3>
<p><em>Deep Purple</em> have had as many lineup changes as any band you can mention, and are still going today. In fact, their 2017 album <strong>Infinite</strong> is on the longlist for that year, though I need more time with it to see if it makes the shortlist. <strong>Burn</strong>, however, was &quot;the first <em>Deep Purple</em> album to feature then-unknown David Coverdale on vocals&quot;, and doesn't it just? Blackmore is on fire, Coverdale and Glenn Hughes smash the vocals out of the park, and mainstays Lord and Paice do what they do best. I hadn't properly consumed this album until recently, only really being familiar with the title track, but it is indeed a cracker. <strong>Top track</strong>: &quot;Burn&quot;, natch.</p>
<h2>Winner</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.queenonline.com/">Queen</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sheer-Heart-Attack-2011-Remaster/dp/B004M17ITE/">Sheer Heart Attack</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2018/01/qu-heart-300.jpg" alt="Queen - Sheer Heart Attack"></p>
<p>Back to the mixed bag of <em>Queen</em> then, to round this thing out. This was in fact their second album of 1974, following the release of <strong>Queen II</strong> earlier on, and it is an entirely different gunnysack of weaselfish than the band's first two albums which were heavily 70s-prog influenced. This for me was where they started to really find their stride and start writing true <em>Queen</em> material, and while there are occasional oddities (&quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot;, anyone?) it's otherwise solid and home to not only classics like &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; and &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, but my favourite <em>Queen</em> song of all time, &quot;Now I'm Here&quot;.</p>
<p>Not perfect, but bloody good.</p>
<p><strong>Top tracks:</strong> &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, &quot;Now I'm Here&quot;, &quot;Killer Queen&quot;</p>
