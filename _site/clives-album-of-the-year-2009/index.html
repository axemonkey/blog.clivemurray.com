<p>In 2009 we lost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson#Death_and_memorial">Michael Jackson</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Swayze#Illness_and_death">Patrick Swayze</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</a> was awarded the Nobel prize for peace, there was a coup d'état in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar">Madagascar</a> and swine flu <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_outbreak">broke out in Mexico</a>. Flight 1549 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_1549">ditched in the Hudson River with zero loss of life</a>, the civil war in Sri Lanka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War">came to an end</a>, as did my ten-year stint in advertising, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3hanna_Sigur%C3%B0ard%C3%B3ttir">Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir</a> was elected as Iceland's first female prime minister and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_first_LGBT_holders_of_political_offices">first openly gay head of state</a> in the modern world.</p>
<p>It was a cracking year for music too, and shortlisted albums that didn't even make my 5 runner-up slots include <em>Muse</em> - <strong>The Resistance</strong>, <em>Ludovico Einaudi</em> - <strong>Nightbook</strong>, <em>Steel Panther</em> - <strong>Feel the Steel</strong>, <em>The Prodigy</em> - <strong>Invaders Must Die</strong>, <em>Devin Townsend Project</em> - <strong>Ki</strong>, <em>Lynch Mob</em> - <strong>Smoke &amp; Mirrors</strong>, <em>Yoshida Brothers</em> - <strong>Prism</strong>, <em>Ensiferum</em> - <strong>From Afar</strong>, and more!</p>
<h2>Honourable mentions</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.alestorm.net">Alestorm</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Sails-At-Midnight-Alestorm/dp/B0021UDJM8/">Black Sails at Midnight</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/alestorm_black-sails-at-midnight.jpg" alt="Alestorm – Black Sails at Midnight"> YARRR! In 2009 I was deep in the grip of my folk-metal obsession and completely unaware that Pirate Metal was even a thing, when along came <em>Alestorm</em> and fair shivered me timbers, so they did. Some people I know just can't get on with the singer, but for me that's proper pirate vocals. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;That Famous Ol' Spiced&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://florenceandthemachine.net/">Florence + the Machine</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lungs-Florence-The-Machine/dp/B001PB3RU8">Lungs</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/florence-and-the-machine_lungs.jpg" alt="Florence + the Machine – Lungs"> Another amazing voice, Florence Welch and her popular beat combo took the charts by storm in 2009, and I for one applauded. This aptly named album is chock full of great pop songs, and she really can belt them out. Beezer. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.halestormrocks.com/">Halestorm</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Halestorm/dp/B001SGEUNI/">Halestorm</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/halestorm_halestorm.jpg" alt="Halestorm – Halestorm"> Yep, <em>Alestorm</em><strong>and</strong><em>Halestorm</em>. Crazy, right? I only got into <em>Halestorm</em> recently (2014), but this, their debut album, is a total corker and Lzzy Hale's voice is one of the best female voices in rock. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;It's Not You&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://thelastvegas.com/">The Last Vegas</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Whatever-Gets-You-Last-Vegas/dp/B001TD1XV2/">Whatever Gets You Off</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/the-last-vegas_whatever-gets-you-off.jpg" alt="The Last Vegas – Whatever Gets You Off"> I do like the sleaze, it must be said. A cracking collection of proper old-fashioned sleazy rock songs from Chicago, this was <em>TLV</em>'s major label debut and it's ace. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Whatever Gets You Off&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.mumfordandsons.com/">Mumford &amp; Sons</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sigh-No-More-Mumford-Sons/dp/B002PHYNRM/">Sigh No More</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/mumford-and-sons_sigh-no-more.jpg" alt="Mumford &amp; Sons – Sigh No More"> Go on, get it out. You'll feel better. No, not <em>that</em>, put that away, that's disgusting. No, I mean get all the anti-<em>Mumford</em> bile out. Go on, bang on for a while about how twee and generic their songs are, and how there are a million better faux-lk (fauk folk, get it?) groups out there and the Mumfords are just knocking out recycled insipid shite. Go on, I'll wait. In fact I'll go and get a coffee. You probably want about 2 or 3 minutes on that yeah? Cool. Off you go.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>All done? Good. Now piss off, I'm going to curl up on the sofa with this cuppa and the Mumfords on the stereo. Lovely. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Dust Bowl Dance&quot;</p>
<h2>And the winner is...</h2>
<h3><a href="http://amorphis.net/">Amorphis</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Skyforger-Amorphis/dp/B0024G4ZEK/">Skyforger</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/amorphis_skyforger.jpeg" alt="Amorphis - Skyforger">
Ah yes, <em>Amorphis</em>. This was in fact the first folk-metal album I ever heard, and it's still one of the best. It doesn't use the overtly folkish elements the way that <em>Eluveitie</em> do (no hurdy-gurdies or penny whistles here) but it does draw on folk elements in the sound and you always feel like you're being told a story. Of course, for the most part that's exactly what's happening, since <em>Amorphis</em> (like some other Finnish folk metal bands) often draw from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalevala">Kalevala</a>, the Epic Poem of Finland, as a source for their lyrics.</p>
<p>The thing that really holds my attention here is the huge magnetic presence of Tomi Joutsen's vocals filling every corner of the band's sound. Don't get me wrong - the band are all excellent - but the character and depth of Tomi's voice as he weaves these tales just transports me to some campfire in the wilderness, wrapped in a sheepskin and sipping brandy from a flask.</p>
<p>Or something.</p>
<p><strong>Top tracks:</strong> &quot;Silver Bride&quot;, &quot;Skyforger&quot;, &quot;Sampo&quot;</p>
