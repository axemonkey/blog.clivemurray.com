<p><em>Please note: this post was written in 2013 and is now really rather out of date.</em></p>
<p>It occurs to me that others may want to set up a <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> blog on their Raspberry Pi, and may be interested in how I went about it.</p>
<p>95% of the process is <a href="http://c-mobberley.com/wordpress/index.php/2013/10/20/raspberry-pi-installation-of-ghost-with-node-js-the-open-source-blogging-platform/">documented very helpfully here by Chris Mobberly</a>, for which I am most grateful.</p>
<p>I started with a fresh install of Raspbian. My Pi's SD card is a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">NOOBS</a> (New Out Of Box Software) card, so all I had to do was reboot and hold down shift to go into recovery mode, and that let me reinstall Raspbian from scratch.</p>
<p>Then I followed Chris's splendid tutorial to get Ghost up and running on the Pi. Once it was installed and running I set it to run on port 80, and forwarded that port to the Pi on my router. At that point I could surf to my external IP address (easy to test if you have a smartphone, just turn wi-fi off and surf to it via 3G) and see the Ghost landing page.</p>
<p>From that point the blog was externally visible, but only via an IP address, and one which would change every now and then since I don't have a static IP from my ISP. To solve that I signed up for a free account at <a href="http://www.noip.com">noip.com</a> and installed their client on the Pi. There's more on that in <a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~ll2bf/docs/nix/rpi_server.html">this tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after that was done, this blog became visible at <a href="http://axemonkey.no-ip.biz">http://axemonkey.no-ip.biz</a> and even if my IP changed, the Noip client would keep the DNS pointing to the right place.</p>
<p>The final step was to decide on a domain name, and after a little deliberation I picked / and then upgraded my Noip account to a paid account, which then lets you use your own domain name.</p>
<p>Simple, really. :)</p>
