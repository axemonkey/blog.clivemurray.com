<p>I'm Clive. Rock guitarist and gentleman adventurer from a land before time. I am also at <a href="https://clivemurray.com/">clivemurray.com</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a web developer by day, currently working at <a href="https://www.springernature.com/">Springer Nature</a> and rock guitarist by night. My band is <a href="http://indigodown.com/">Indigo Down</a>.</p>
<p>I released a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Earthman-Clive-Murray/dp/B002EKDYDE/">solo instrumental album called &quot;Earthman&quot;</a> in 2002, and have been working on the follow-up since then. <a href="https://loveandpainkillers.com/">I made a site to show how that's going</a>.</p>
<p>I live in Hemel Hempstead with my family and cats.</p>
<p>This blog lives on a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> in my house, and is powered by <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>.</p>
<p>You can email me on <a href="mailto:hi@clivemurray.com">hi@clivemurray.com</a> if the desire so takes you.</p>
<p>I used to Twitter as <a href="https://www.twitter.com/axemonkey">@axemonkey</a>, but Elongated Muskrat ruined all that. (I still maintain my account, but don't post there any more. If you really need to get hold of my via Twitter, I might still get it.)</p>
<p>But now I am on a splendid instance of Mastodon instead, so feel free to toot me at <a href="https://metalhead.club/@axemonkey">@axemonkey@metalhead.club</a>.</p>
