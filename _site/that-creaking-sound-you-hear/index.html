<p>...is this blog trying to live.</p>
<p>I'm not promising to post much, but I am at least trying to get the thing working again.</p>
<p>This blog lives on a Raspberry Pi in my house. It runs on the excellent <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a>. I got it running using the latest version of Ghost at the time, which was v0.6.0, and then left it. I posted stuff, I tweaked the theme, it worked.</p>
<p>Then I just stopped posting, because that's what happens. Blogging always goes in phases. But one day I went into the admin interface and saw that Ghost was now on version 0.11.x and I had missed a whole load of upgrades. So I tried to upgrade... and killed the whole thing.</p>
<p>I ended up in a labyrinthine mess of being unable to update sqlite3 (the database that Ghost uses) on the version of Node.js I had, but if I upgraded to the new version of Node I would have to upgrade to the latest version of Ghost, and my old posts would probably get lost, as the database migrations wouldn't work...</p>
<p>Whatever. I've now got Ghost up to v0.7.9 and Node up to 0.12.something and I'm leaving it there until I have a little more time to do some more incremental updates, each one of which will migrate the database forward, until I get to the latest version.</p>
<p>At which time I will probably forget about it, and the whole thing will atrophy again.</p>
<p>Ho hum.</p>
