<p>1997 was the year I first got a modem and discovered the Internet, a move that ended up providing me with a career but started with a £10/month <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Internet">Demon</a> account and a 19.2kbps (it was supposed to be 28.8kbps but I think it was a bit fucked and it never once connected at that speed) modem.</p>

<p>Musically it was… really not great. Not great at all.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Still… there were a couple of shiny-ish flecks in the swathes of aural dung…</p>
<h2>Honourable mentions</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.benfolds.com/">Ben Folds Five</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Whatever-Ever-Amen-Folds-Five/dp/B000024IHS/">Whatever and Ever Amen</a></h3>
<p>I only got into <em>Ben Folds Five</em> through a friend, and only then into a few choice tracks. Turns out most of them are on this album, and on listening back to it again, it's cracking. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;The Battle of Who Could Care Less&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansun">Mansun</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Attack-Grey-Lantern-Mansun/dp/B0000071WJ/">Attack of the Grey Lantern</a></h3>
<p>Can't remember where I heard of <em>Mansun</em>, but once I did I grabbed this album (their debut) and really dug it. Weird UK alt-rock with a really immersive feel. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Wide Open Space&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://primusville.com/">Primus</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Brown-Album-Primus/dp/B000001Y47/">The Brown Album</a></h3>
<p><em>Primus</em>. If you don't know, then I really can't tell you. I wouldn't recommend this as your first <em>Primus</em> album either, if you're a virgin. But if you know them and love them then you should get this. Mind you, you probably already have it. I'll stop now. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Shake Hands With Beef&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.theprodigy.co.uk/">The Prodigy</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fat-Land-Prodigy/dp/B000006TNS/">Fat of the Land</a></h3>
<p>As has been intimated previously, I've never been much of a dance head. But throughout the late 90s The Prodge were ubiquitous and the very block-rockingest of their beats are all right here (and yes, I'm fully aware that's a <em>Chemical Brothers</em>, not <em>Prodigy</em> reference, thanks). Still bitch-up-smackingly good, if I may. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Breathe&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.radiohead.co.uk/">Radiohead</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/OK-Computer-Radiohead/dp/B000002UJQ/">OK Computer</a></h3>
<p>Yeeeeeah. So. About that. Post <strong>The Bends</strong>, I fell out of love with <em>Radiohead</em>. In truth, I'm still in two minds about this album. One thing you can't deny is its impact on the music of the time - if <em>The Prodigy</em> were everywhere in the late 90s, then <em>Radiohead</em> were even everywherer. I will say I've gradually warmed to it over the last 18 years. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;</p>
<h2>And the winner is…</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.dreamtheater.net/">Dream Theater</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Falling-Into-Infinity-Dream-Theater/dp/B000002HPT/">Falling Into Infinity</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2018/03/Dream_Theater_-_Falling_into_Infinity_Album_Cover.jpg" alt="Dream Theater - Falling Into Infinity"></p>
<p>Yep, I'm the one who likes it.</p>
<p>I gather that the <em>DT</em> faithful see this as the album where they sold out and tried to sound more commercial.</p>
<p>Well, fuck 'em.</p>
<p>Faithful <em>Dream Theater</em> fans are the kind of people who think Jordan Rudess was a good thing to happen to the band, so they can fuck off. I lamented the departure of Kevin Moore like anyone else, but I thought Derek Sherinian was a splendid replacement, bringing a bluesier edge to the band's sound and dare I say it, some soul - something the more clinical musicians in the band (i.e. the rest of them) are often sorely lacking.</p>
<p>I'm fully willing to go on the record saying that this is the last <em>DT</em> album that I properly enjoyed. Since then (and don't fucking start with any of that <strong>Scenes From a Memory</strong> bullshit, either) every single one of their albums has been around 70 mins of miscellaneous prog beige. You could start it at any point in the record, play it for a while, then turn it off. It just depends how much you want.</p>
<p>&quot;How much <em>Dream Theater</em> do you want today, Gladys?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, just cut us about 40 minutes off the end will you Alf, I'm not that hungry today.&quot;</p>
<p>I mean yes, it's all incredibly executed and very clever, but I just find it all just so <em>so</em> soulless.</p>
<p>Not so, <strong>Falling Into Infinity</strong>. I can actually sing you lines from several of the songs without having to look at the lyrics! I can recall more than four of the song titles without looking at the CD cover! This was truly the last time I could claim that, and I really tried with the later bollocks, I honestly did.</p>
<p>This all sounds awfully apologetic - it shouldn't. <strong>FII</strong> is a really good album - and remember it's only the third full-length album they released (in the LaBrie era, let's pretend the Dominici stuff didn't happen, it's best for everyone), and it felt to me like a proper natural progression from <strong>Awake</strong> and the intervening (but patchily produced) EP <strong>A Change of Seasons</strong>.</p>
<p>It's great. Bung it on and stop being a gimp. Or don't. The choice is almost literally yours.</p>
<p><strong>Top tracks:</strong> &quot;Lines in the Sand&quot;, &quot;New Millennium&quot;, &quot;Trial of Tears&quot;</p>
<h2>Turkey of the Year</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.motley.com/">Mötley Crüe</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Generation-Swine-M%C3%B6tley-Cr%C3%BCe/dp/B005SN9RPI/">Generation Swine</a></h3>
<p>Oh good lord, no. If you read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Swine">the wiki page for this album</a> it's easy to see why it's so bad… but that doesn't make it any better. Gah.</p>
