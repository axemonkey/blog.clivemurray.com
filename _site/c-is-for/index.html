<h2>C is for… <a href="http://cloudkickermusic.com/">Cloudkicker</a></h2>
<p><em>(Image on loan from Cloudkicker's Bandcamp)</em></p>
<p>In around 2011 I discovered a number of heavy instrumental acts who rocked my bell, among them <em>Scale the Summit</em>, <em>Chimp Spanner</em>, <em>Sithu Aye</em>, the mighty <em>Plini</em> and <em>Cloudkicker</em>. This last is in fact a one-man act, and that man is Ben Sharp. Like a few of the others I discovered around this time, Ben writes, produces, programs and plays everything you hear, and releases his music on the splendid <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> platform, rendering him truly a one-man-band.</p>
<p><em>Cloudkicker</em>'s music is very hard to categorise, though I wouldn't be a proper music journalist if I didn't at least attempt to pigeonhole him a little, so let's call it &quot;heavy ambient guitar math prog metal&quot;. Then again, I'm not in fact a journalist of any kind at all, so I can call it what I want, and for now I shall just say it is very good indeed.</p>
<p>What it also is, is varied. I don't think Ben has any grand plan in place for his releases and just writes what he feels at the time, so his works vary a lot in tone and feel. <strong>Beacons</strong> is perhaps his best known release, and that is a structured melodic yet intricate metal album whereas <strong>Fade</strong> and <strong>Let Yourself Be Huge</strong> are far more mellow and introspective, and the <strong>Portmanteau</strong> and the bafflingly titled <strong>]]][[[</strong> EPs are just mental. The consistent through-line of all of his music would be ever shifting textural guitar patterns. Whether it's something angular and challenging like &quot;Fourteen Nights&quot; from <strong>Portmanteau</strong> or something more thoughtful like &quot;LA After Rain&quot; from <strong>Fade</strong>, Ben is a genius at creating ever-shifting fabric-like textures that change and morph subtly while seeming to stay at least recognisably the same. It's kind of the guitar equivalent of M.C. Escher's tessellating works such as &quot;Day and Night&quot;, &quot;Metamorphosis II&quot; and &quot;Sky and Water I&quot;.</p>
<p>Ben is not what I would call a shredder or even perhaps a lead guitarist in the most obvious sense, but he is a master of making interesting guitar music, much – perhaps all – of which you can download right now (and name your own price, mind you… yes literally…) from <a href="https://cloudkickermusic.com/music">his Bandcamp site</a>. I suggest you do. If any of this frightens you, start with <strong>Fade</strong> or <strong>Woum</strong>. If not, crack on with <strong>Beacons</strong>. Personally I would get it all – I know I did.</p>
<h2>Clive recommends:</h2>
<p>I reckon <a href="https://cloudkickermusic.com/album/beacons"><strong>Beacons</strong></a> is a good place to start kicking clouds.</p>
<h2>Video evidence</h2>
<p>Mr. Kicker is not seemingly a particularly fanatical self promoter, and while he continues to produce and release music on a continual slow burn, finding live footage of him playing was quite a task. I mean it took me literally almost a <em>minute</em> on YouTube to find you the following, but find it I did. Here then, is Ben playing live with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intronaut">Intronaut</a> as his backing band, performing &quot;Push it way up!&quot; from <strong>Beacons</strong>. I totally did find it though. Look.</p>
