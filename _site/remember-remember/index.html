<p>A friend just posted on Twitter &quot;Remember, remember the 5th of November&quot; and I immediately felt crushingly depressed.</p>
<p>He doesn't know of course - why would he? - that 5th November 2012 was the day my Dad died.</p>
<p>I remember clearly waking up at 7am as per usual (it was a Monday morning) and seeing missed calls from my Mum timed at around 4am. I knew then that he was gone, and the first feeling I experienced was a huge rush of relief. He'd been ill for a long time - he was diagnosed with lymphoma (my memory refuses to recall whether it was non-Hodgkins or not - at this point it doesn't matter) two years previously and given six months to live, but the doctors hadn't taken into account what tough old bugger Tom was.</p>
<p>After the initial wave of relief there was just numbness - shock, I suppose - and I began the process of calling work and telling them I wouldn't be in for a while, then packing a bag and heading down to Eastbourne. I'd already done the crying and the grief two years previously. If I recall correctly when I heard the original diagnosis I crawled inside a Scotch bottle and stayed there for a few days. My employers at the time were an understanding bunch, thankfully.</p>
<p>Today, a year later, I'm sitting here at work trying to give a toss and honestly not really doing very well at it. Later I shall raise a glass or two to the old fella, though within sensible limits.</p>
<p>I will always remember the 5th of November with mixed feelings. I just need to learn to nod and smile when people invoke the poem.</p>
<p>Miss you Dad, you silly sod.</p>
