<p>2004 was a leap year starting on a Thursday, and soon after that I turned 30. It was also the International Year of Rice.</p>

<h2>Honourable mentions</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.alterbridge.com/">Alter Bridge</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/One-Day-Remains-Alter-Bridge/dp/B002LK0XIG/">One Day Remains</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/alter-bridge_one-day-remains.jpg" alt="Alter Bridge – One Day Remains"> Yep, <em>Alter Bridge</em> again. Honestly, one of the best heavy rock bands around, and this was their debut album. It's amazing from start to finish - one of the best debuts ever. Shits all over <em>Creed</em> from the greatest of heights. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;One Day Remains&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.greenday.com/">Green Day</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/American-Idiot-Green-Day/dp/B0002OERI0/">American Idiot</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/green-day_american-idiot.jpg" alt="Green Day – American Idiot"> You've always known what you're going to get with a <em>Green Day</em> album - well delivered straight-ahead punky rock with plenty of attitude - but for me this was where they took it up a notch and really felt like they had something to say. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://the-streets.co.uk/">The Streets</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grand-Dont-Come-For-Free/dp/B0001XARU4/">A Grand Don’t Come For Free</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/the-streets_a-grand-dont-come-for-free.jpg" alt="The Streets – A Grand Don’t Come For Free"> I really don't do the hippety-hop, save for the mighty <em>Scroobius Pip</em>, but when I gave this &quot;rap opera&quot; concept album a crack I couldn't get enough. Skinner is properly clever with his lyrics and the tunes are engaging. Plus I've totally been that guy in the club in &quot;Blinded By The Lights&quot; once or twice. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Blinded By The Lights&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.velvetrevolver.com/">Velvet Revolver</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Contraband-Velvet-Revolver/dp/B0001Z2Q74/">Contraband</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/velvet-revolver_contraband.jpg" alt="Velvet Revolver – Contraband"> I love <em>Slash</em> and everything he does, so when he reunited with Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum of <em>Guns N' Roses</em> to form a supergroup with Scott Weiland of <em>Stone Temple Pilots</em> on vocals, I was sure the resulting album would be stellar. You know what? It is. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Headspace&quot;</p>
<h2>And the winners are…</h2>
<p>I couldn’t separate the top two for this year - so it’s a tie!</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.maxrichtermusic.com/">Max Richter</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blue-Notebooks-Richter-Max-Audio/dp/B00G2IZKU4/">The Blue Notebooks</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/max-richter_the-blue-notebooks.jpg" alt="Max Richter - The Blue Notebooks">
I first encountered the neoclassical stylings of <em>Max Richter</em> on Classic FM a few years ago. I was returning home late one evening and as I parked outside my house I was transfixed by the short piece playing on the radio - it turned out to be &quot;H In New England&quot; from Richter's 2008 album <strong>24 Postcards In Full Colour</strong>. I immediately sought out more information and promptly bought all the CDs I could find, the pinnacle of which being this one. Utterly sublime.</p>
<p><strong>Top tracks:</strong> &quot;On The Nature Of Daylight&quot;, &quot;The Trees&quot;, &quot;Arboretum&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.williamshatner.com/">William Shatner</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Has-Been-William-Shatner/dp/B0002XK4CO/">Has Been</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/william-shatner_has-been.jpeg" alt="William Shatner - Has Been">
I've tried before to tell people about this album, and I know I've failed. So I'm going to have one more go.</p>
<p>It's not a joke. I don't like it because it's &quot;so bad it's good&quot;. Irony is not involved, though intentional comedy is, on occasion.</p>
<p>OK? Do you get it? Yes, William Shatner. No, not kidding.</p>
<p>See, the music is co-written, produced and arranged by Ben Folds. In fact, I get the idea that in many cases Shatner has scribbled down some words and Folds has basically done the rest, but no matter. What you've got here (ignoring the attention-grabbing opener, a cover of <em>Pulp</em>'s &quot;Common People&quot;) is a guy laying his soul bare to music. &quot;That's Me Trying&quot; is an open letter to Shatner's estranged daughter. &quot;It Hasn't Happened Yet&quot; is a chronicle of his trials and failings as he sees them. &quot;Has Been&quot; is a nod to the fact that perhaps his glory days are behind him. &quot;You'll Have Time&quot; is a knowing wink and a smile to his own mortality. &quot;I Can't Get Behind That&quot; is just Shatner and Henry Rollins cooped up in a studio and revelling in the joy of yelling about shit that annoys them. And &quot;What Have You Done&quot;… well I can't talk about that one - you should just listen to it and you'll see.</p>
<p>Honestly. No guff, Chet.</p>
<p><strong>Top tracks:</strong> &quot;It Hasn’t Happened Yet&quot;, &quot;I Can't Get Behind That&quot;, &quot;You'll Have Time&quot;</p>
<h2>Turkey of the Year</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.razorlight.co.uk/">Razorlight</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Up-All-Night-Razorlight/dp/B0009353JQ/">Up All Night</a></h3>
<p>Fuck <strong>all</strong> of that noise.</p>
