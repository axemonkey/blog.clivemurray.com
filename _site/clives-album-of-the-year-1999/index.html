<p>In Summer 1999 I met a girl. We hooked up for a bit and it didn’t really work out. But then in Autumn I met another girl. We hooked up and 15 years later I’m proud to call her my wife. :)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos">The Sopranos</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Guy">Family Guy</a> both debuted on US television, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_worm">Melissa</a> &quot;attacked the internet&quot;, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre">Columbine massacre</a> happened, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Dando">Jill Dando</a> was shot dead on her doorstep, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_The_Phantom_Menace">The Phantom Menace</a> um… happened, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">Napster</a> debuted, we had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_11,_1999">total solar eclipse</a> which I peered at through the clouds on a rooftop in Soho, having landed my first London job, Apple released the G4 and Sega released the Dreamcast.</p>
<p>It was thank you and goodnight to (among, as always, many others) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Springfield">Dusty Springfield</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehudi_Menuhin">Yehudi Menuhin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Wise">Little Ern</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Bogarde">Dirk Bogarde</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeForest_Kelley">Bones (DeForest Kelly)</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Llewelyn">Q (Desmond Llewelyn)</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screaming_Lord_Sutch">Screaming Lord Sutch</a> and the mighty, mighty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Reed">Oliver Reed</a>.</p>
<p>On millennium night I played a covers gig in Hastings, where for the first half we partied like it was 1999, because it was. And then it wasn't. But we carried on anyway.</p>
<h2>Honourable mentions</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.buckcherry.com/">Buckcherry</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Buckcherry/dp/B00000IGQU/">Buckcherry</a></h3>
<p>I've written much about <em>Buckcherry</em> as it is, but this was their debut album. I missed it at the time and came to it later, and still to this day prefer the followup <strong>Time Bomb</strong>, but this is still a righteous rocking album. Proper raw rock and roll. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Lawless And Lulu&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.ludovicoeinaudi.com/">Ludovico Einaudi</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eden-Roc-Einaudi/dp/B001HQTEYO/">Eden Roc</a></h3>
<p>I've only quite recently discovered the minimalist stylings of <em>Ludo</em>, but when I heard him on Classic FM I rushed out and bought just about everything of his I could find. Minimal classical, nothing too challenging, perhaps a little anodyne for some, but I love it. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Due Tramonti&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.powerman5000.com/">Powerman 5000</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tonight-Stars-Revolt-Powerman-5000/dp/B00000JMXV/">Tonight The Stars Revolt!</a></h3>
<p>No idea where I first heard &quot;Nobody's Real&quot; but when I did it made me want more, and this is such a cracking album. Snarly punk-industrial-metal (nu, perhaps… shudder…) and great fun throughout. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Nobody's Real&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://">Red Hot Chilli Peppers</a> - <a href="http://">Californication</a></h3>
<p>This was the <em>Chillis</em>' first studio album in four years, and marked the return of John Frusciante on the six-string twangplank. It remains their best-selling album ever, though for my money it's slightly bettered by <a href="/clives-album-of-the-year-2002/">2002</a>'s <strong>By The Way</strong>. Still great though. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.stereophonics.com/">Stereophonics</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Performance-Cocktails-Stereophonics/dp/B00000ILO7/">Performance And Cocktails</a></h3>
<p>The <em>'phonics</em> were everywhere in 1999. You couldn't move for &quot;The Bartender and the Thief&quot;, &quot;Just Looking&quot; and &quot;Pick a Part That's New&quot;, and that was because they're ace songs. The rest of the album is just as great, if not greater. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Pick A Part That's New&quot;</p>
<h2>And the winner is…</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.underworldlive.com/">Underworld</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beaucoup-Fish-Underworld/dp/B000023Y31/">Beaucoup Fish</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2018/03/u.jpg" alt="Underworld - Beaucoup Fish"></p>
<p>King of Snake, King of Snake.</p>
<p>Tina lives in Berlin, her voice so seldom on my machine.</p>
<p>Etc.</p>
<p>Again, I was late to the <strong>Underworld</strong> party, but my mate trying hard to get me to listen to something that didn't at least feature a fast lead guitarist must have finally broken through because one day I saw the light. I won't lie to you, drugs probably played a part. This is <em>splendid</em> music to get at least partially out of your face to. In fact I think I'd been listening to this album for a number of years before I realised that the lyrics to &quot;Push Upstairs&quot; and &quot;Push Downstairs&quot; are the same, and that one is a downtempo moody version of the other. Which is quite clever, though I obviously wasn't.</p>
<p>Intelligent, dancey electronica that isn't afraid to go dark occasionally all carried along by Karl Hyde's swirling stream-of-consciousness lyrics.</p>
<p>And, to quote Rufus (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Ted%27s_Excellent_Adventure">Bill &amp; Ted</a>), it's <em>excellent</em> for dancing.</p>
<p><strong>Top tracks:</strong> &quot;Push Upstairs&quot;, &quot;King Of Snake&quot;, &quot;Cups&quot;</p>
<h2>Turkey of the Year</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.mrbigsite.com/">Mr. Big</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Get-Over-Mr-Big/dp/B00002DEPB/">Get Over It</a></h3>
<p>Oh dear. For me <strong>Mr. Big</strong> needed Paul Gilbert's sense of humour running through their music to make it listenable, and his replacement Richie Kotzen - while an absolutely incredible musician - is pretty po-faced, and the band lost something vital at this point.</p>
