<p>2002 was the first palindromic year since 1991 and the last until 2112. It started on a Tuesday, which was the day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro">the Euro</a> first became legal tender.</p>
<p>2002 marked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II">Q-Tip</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II">Golden Jubilee</a> on February 6th, though her sister - Princess Margaret - died from a stroke in her sleep three days later, and The Queen Mother died in March. Mixed fortunes for the Windsors there, then.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantophasmatodea">A new insect order</a> was discovered, BT Cellnet rebranded as O2, Brazil won <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup_Final">the World Cup</a>, central Europe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_European_floods">flooded</a> and Dubya gave birth to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security">the Department of Homeland Security</a>.</p>
<p>We lost (as always, among many others) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Jones">Chuck Jones</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Milligan">Spike Milligan</a> (turns out he <em>was</em> ill), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudley_Moore">Dudley Moore</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layne_Staley">Layne Staley</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_Heyerdahl">Thor Heyerdahl</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Lovelace">Linda Lovelace</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Entwistle">John Entwhistle</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Harris_(actor)">Richard Harris</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam-Master_Jay">Jam-Master Jay</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Coburn">James Coburn</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Strummer">Joe Strummer</a>.</p>
<p>2002 is also the name of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_%28band%29">new age band from Texas</a>.</p>
<h2>Honourable mentions</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.acommunication.co.uk/">A</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hi-Fi-Serious/dp/B00006349V/">Hi-Fi Serious</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/a_hifi-serious.jpg" alt="A – Hi-Fi Serious"> The least web-search-compatible band in the world, <em>A</em> had released two albums before this but my advice is to skip them - the songs and the production don't come anywhere near close to matching this cracker. Punchy as hell and great fun throughout. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Nothing&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.freakkitchen.com/">Freak Kitchen</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Move-Freak-Kitchen/dp/B00008XVHY/">Move</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/freak-kitchen_move.jpg" alt="Freak Kitchen – Move"> In 2002 I became aware of many of my guitarist friends suddenly raving about this Swedish guy called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattias_Eklundh"><em>Mattias Eklundh</em></a>. I found his first solo album mind-blowing and impenetrable in equal measure, but when I heard his band this album became an instant favourite. Clever, sometimes heavy, always interesting. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Nobody's Laughing&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.paulgilbert.com/">Paul Gilbert</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Burning-Organ-Paul-Gilbert/dp/B000084IP7/">Burning Organ</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/paul-gilbert_burning-organ.jpg" alt="Paul Gilbert – Burning Organ"> I've always dug <em>PG</em>'s solo albums, though due to his self-confessed &quot;pop voice&quot; they are sometimes a little ballad-laden. This one rocks out though - it even starts with a track called &quot;I Like Rock&quot;.  <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;My Religion&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.porcupinetree.com/">Porcupine Tree</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Absentia-European-Porcupine-Tree/dp/B00007J36G/">In Absentia</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/porcupine-tree_in-absentia.jpg" alt="Porcupine Tree – In Absentia"> During my time in advertising, I made one of the best friends of my life - Mr <a href="http://imakethingswork.com/">Mathias Hellquist</a> - and it was he who introduced me to this album, which proved to be a gateway drug to the whole <em>Porcupine Tree</em> back catalogue. This one is for my money the pinnacle of the oeuvre, though that may be because I haven't spent enough time with its successors. Either way, it's magnificent. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Blackest Eyes&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.redhotchilipeppers.com/">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Way-Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers/dp/B000067CPX/">By The Way</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/red-hot-chilli-peppers_by-the-way.jpg" alt="Red Hot Chili Peppers – By The Way"> You could not move for this album in 2002-2004 or so. You know why? It's <em>good</em>. <strong>Top track:</strong> &quot;Can't Stop&quot;</p>
<h2>And the winner is…</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.damienrice.com">Damien Rice</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/O-Damien-Rice/dp/B0000AXKRB/">O</a></h3>
<p><img src="/public/images/2020/06/damien-rice_o.jpeg" alt="Damien Rice - O">
Oh god, this album.</p>
<p>It took me a while to get down into it, having been played it a few times at a friend's flat, but a few more repeat listens and a heart-rending live gig at the Union Chapel later and I was a <em>Damien Rice</em> convert. This album…</p>
<p>This album.</p>
<p>I find it hard to even write about, since I often find it hard to listen to. And I find it hard to listen to purely because if I actually pay attention to it (as opposed to, say, having it in my headphones while working) then I find it drags me on an emotional roller-coaster journey that frankly wears me out. I know music is <em>supposed</em> to do that, that's generally <em>the idea</em>. But the epic trek comprised of these ten tracks demands a lot of the listener. Don't get me wrong, it's not challenging music - it's just… <strong>deep</strong>. I think. I could be wrong.</p>
<p>I'll say this - go with it. You'll get back at least as much as you put in, though you might end up a little different by the end.</p>
<p><strong>Top tracks:</strong> &quot;The Blower's Daughter&quot;, &quot;Amie&quot;, &quot;Cannonball&quot;</p>
<h2>Turkey of the Year</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.rush.com/">Rush</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Vapor-Trails-Rush/dp/B000065DTE/">Vapor Trails</a></h3>
<p>Bleurch. Honestly. Wow. No. Don't do that.</p>
