## The one-liners

- [*Alter Bridge*](https://alterbridge.com/) – [**Pawns & Kings**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/PAWNS-KINGS-Alter-Bridge/dp/B0B6XHYR1Z/). (Heavy rock/metal.) Another solid album from Kennedy, Tremonti et al., though perhaps they are beginning to all sound a bit samey. Still good though.
- [*Halestorm*](http://www.halestormrocks.com/) – [**Back From the Dead**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Back-Dead-Deluxe-Halestorm/dp/B0BJYGHXHX/). (Hard rock.) Lzzy Hale and her gang doing what they do best.
- [*Jean-Michel Jarre*](https://jeanmicheljarre.com/) – [**Oxymore**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/music/player/albums/B0B57CYQW1). (World/ambient/new age.) A more ambient side of J-MJ. If that’s what you want, then… um… this is that.
- [*King’s X*](http://kingsxrocks.com/) – [**Three Sides of One**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Three-Sides-One-Ltd-Digipak/dp/B0B4K28L88/). (Rock.) Dug Pinnick is 73. He still sounds amazing.
- [*Megadeth*](https://megadeth.com/) – [**The Sick, the Dying… and the Dead!**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sick-Dying-Dead-Megadeth/dp/B0B1QXJ93D/). (Metal/thrash.) Yes, Dave Mustaine is still sneering down the mic at us all and he still doesn’t like the government. Kiko’s solos are worth the price of admission alone.
* [*Mr. Fastfinger*](http://mrfastfinger.net/) - [**Flight Mode**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BK2X7W6K). (Instrumental.) The sprightly Finn returns with ten more tracks of his wonderful compositions. Always fun.
- [*Placebo*](http://placeboworld.co.uk/) – [**Never Let Me Go**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/NEVER-AMAZON-EXCLUSIVE-LENTICULAR-DELUXE/dp/B09L3ZVX8D/). (Alt-rock.) I’d never really gotten into *Placebo* but when I saw them supporting *My Chemical Romance* live in 2022 they were great. This is a good record. Moody.
- [*Porcupine Tree*](https://porcupinetree.com/) – [**Closure/Continuation**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Closure-Continuation-Porcupine-Tree/dp/B09KP4H13H/). (Prog rock.) Brit-prog god Steven Wilson returns to his band format for their 11th long-player. Good stuff.
- [*Queensrÿche*](http://queensrycheofficial.com/) – [**Digital Noise Alliance**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Digital-Noise-Alliance-Queensryche/dp/B0B2423WX3/). (Hard rock.) I still can’t get over how much Todd sounds like Geoff, if I’m honest.
- [*Shinedown*](http://shinedown.com/) – [**Planet Zero**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Planet-Zero-Shinedown/dp/B09R6LW4D9/). (Rock.) I mean, if you like that sort of thing then it’s fine. Concepty too, if that helps?
- [*Devin Townsend*](https://hevydevy.com/) – [**Lightwork**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lightwork-Devin-Townsend/dp/B0BBGQY3XZ/). (Prog metal, maybe?) Not quite as mad as **Empath**, but up that end of the wackometer. Some utterly beautiful moments on this one. Recommend.
- [*Steve Vai*](https://vai.com/) – [**Inviolate**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Inviolate-Steve-Vai/dp/B09M545FMY/). (Instrumental rock.) Not sure how many more Vai albums I’m going to go for. Where *Joe Satriani* seems to have found a lot more mojo lately, Steve seems to be wandering more esoteric paths.
- [*Ed Wynne & Gre Vanderloo*](http://www.ozrics.com/) – [**Tumbling Through the Floativerse**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tumbling-Through-Floativerse-Wynne-Tentacles/dp/B0B1621YMB/). (Psychedelic instrumental rock.) Remember when Ed released a solo album that was basically just like *Ozric Tentacles*? Like that.

And that’s without getting into the 2022 releases from [*Florence + the Machine*](https://florenceandthemachine.net/), [*MASTER BOOT RECORD*](https://masterbootrecord.bandcamp.com/), [*Muse*](https://www.muse.mu/), and I’m sure loads of others.

So. Onward.

## Honourable mentions

### [Amorphis](http://amorphis.net/) - [Halo](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Halo-Amorphis/dp/B09MGCTRJJ/)

![Amorphis – Halo](/public/images/2024/02/halo-600x600bb.jpg) I’ve loved these Finnish folkish metallers since I first heard **Skyforger** in 2009, and every album they’ve released since then has gone into heavy rotation as soon as it came out. **Halo** is no exception. Fabulous. **Top track:** “[On the Dark Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8aH5HVx_0c)”

### [Architects](https://architectsofficial.com/) - [The Classic Symptoms of a Broken Spirit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Classic-Symptoms-Broken-Spirit/dp/B0B5MQ4XG5/)

![Architects – The Classic Symptoms of a Broken Spirit](/public/images/2024/02/architects-symptoms-600x600bb.jpg) *Architects* are from Brighton, they don’t drink, and they’re vegans. Despite all of that, they’re absolutely awesome. They romped home with the top prize for [AotY 2021](/clives-album-of-the-year-2021/), as you may or may not, and here they are again the very next year with another absolute utter **slab** of an album. This is some primo metalcore, and you can take that to the bank. **Top track:** “[When We Were Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yOaxGQ-CYI)”

### [Coheed and Cambria](http://coheedandcambria.com/) - [Vaxis II: A Window of the Waking Mind](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vaxis-II-Window-Waking-Mind/dp/B09V8F8VF2/)

![Coheed and Cambria – Vaxis II: A Window of the Waking Mind](/public/images/2024/02/vaxis2-600x600bb.jpg) There’s very little left to say about *Coheed and Cambria*, other than pointing out how absolutely remarkable it is that they are still putting out **flawless** albums. If semi-sci-fi-themed prog rock does it for you, then you should be listening to them non-stop. Brilliant. **Top track:** “[A Disappearing Act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmMI6fEpxns)”

### [Crashdïet](http://crashdiet.org/) - [Automaton](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Automaton-Crashdiet/dp/B09V915XJZ/)

![Crashdïet – Automaton](/public/images/2024/02/automaton-600x600bb.jpg) These Swedish glamsters have had a patchy run of it, to be honest. Their first album (**Rest in Sleaze**, 2005) was very promising if a little naive, but then the singer committed suicide. They borrowed the lead singer from *Reckless Love* for the second one (**The Unattractive Revolution**, 2007) and that was OK, but then Olli Herman went back to his main band. They found another singer (who I thought was a bit of a cock) and did another couple of albums, but by that time I’d tuned out. I didn’t really think about them until they popped up on the Tube of You one day with another new singer, and a really good sound. This album is great from start to nuts, and a guest spot from *Steel Panther*’s Michael Starr doesn’t do any harm. **Top track:** “[No Man’s Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidua-3li_Q&list=OLAK5uy_lBevSvIqc_bPg9ZdU-U90SFArBTmQIxws&index=4)”

### [Polyphia](https://www.polyphia.com/) - [Remember That You Will Die](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Remember-That-You-Will-Die/dp/B0BLHVYBRF/)

![Polyphia – Remember That You Will Die](/public/images/2024/02/rtywd-600x600bb.jpg) This is a tricky one, given that I don’t like about half the tracks on it. Much has been made lately about the “trick cyclist” guitar skills of wunderkind Tim Henson and the equally dextrous Scottie LePage, and there is no denying their technique is mind-blowing. Add to that the absolutely unpossible drumulation from Clay Aeschliman, in which I feel that Tim and the others write the hardest possible trap/hip-hop beats in an effort to write something he can’t play. If that’s the case, they haven’t managed it yet. But… well, it’s an album of at least two halves. See, no-one in the band sings and most of their music is instrumental. That’s great. I love that. ([I also do that](https://loveandpainkillers.com), in case I haven’t mentioned it…) But the Texas quartet aren’t happy to leave it there and give us forty minutes of wailage. No. Instead they recruit guest vocalists for 5 out of the 12 songs. Again, nothing wrong with that. Your man Chino off of *Deftones* is one of them, and that track (“Bloodbath”) is wonderful. Where *Polyphia* lose me is when they recruit rappers and other “young people’s music” vocalists such as [Sophia Black](https://www.vice.com/en/article/rnw75w/sophia-black-anchor-interview), [Killstation](https://en.everybodywiki.com/Killstation), [Lil West](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lil-west/1450576098) and [$not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snot_(rapper)). Thing is, I’m 50, and I’m not the target audience for those songs, and that’s **fine**! Honestly. I love the other tracks enough to still put this album in my AotY 2022 shortlist. My skip button works just fine, and I love the instrumental tracks and “Bloodbath”. Check the video for a guest spot from *Steve Vai*. **Top track:** “[Ego Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JNmz17gnMw&list=PLN0q19AZLbSf-2Q4-2jKzmhs6whjnITud&index=13)”

### [Michael Romeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Romeo) - [War of the Worlds pt. 2](https://www.amazon.co.uk/War-Worlds-Pt-2-Michael-Romeo/dp/B09L4R9M5F/)

![Michael Romeo – War of the Worlds pt. 2](/public/images/2024/02/wotw2-600x600bb.jpg) Well, we had to wait four years for part 2, but it was worth the wait. More of the same, to be honest with you, with one change: vocals this time round are provided by Croatian singer Dino Jelusic, who we last saw round these parts in 2020, knocking about with *George Lynch* on his band project *Dirty Shirley*. Dino has a hell of a voice, and Romeo’s arrangements and solos are impeccable as ever. Don’t try to pecc them, YOU WILL FAIL. **Top track:** “[Metamorphosis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0vu7Ah6pfo)”

### [Joe Satriani](http://satriani.com/) - [The Elephants of Mars](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elephants-Mars-Joe-Satriani/dp/B09QM5T5PV/)

![Joe Satriani – The Elephants of Mars](/public/images/2024/02/heffalumps-600x600bb.jpg) OK so, Satch is important to me, so listen up. I play instrumental rock guitar, as you might know. I [even released my second album in early 2024](https://loveandpainkillers.com/), as you might know. And the reason I started playing that kind of music was when my guitar teacher back in Eastbourne played 15-year-old me the title track from **Surfing With the Alien**, and my mind came clean off. I started to wonder if maybe one day I might be able to play something like that. It seemed impossible then, given I couldn’t quite get my hands around the riff for “Money For Nothing” at that time, but I did always think that maybe one day I might make that kind of music. And so I did. That is why Satch means more to me than Steve Vai, or Paul Gilbert, or Brian May, or anyone else. I got the tab books, and I learned the easy tracks first, and worked up to the harder ones over the years. Then I got a 4-track and a drum machine and started to try and write my own tunes, and the rest is (a lot of) history. So that’s why Satch matters. And that’s why it hurt so much, when in the early 2000s, he began to absolutely *suck*. **Crystal Planet** (1998) is an absolutely brilliant album. Perhaps only **The Extremist** (1992) tops it in Joe’s entire ouvre. But… **Engines of Creation** (2000) is patchy and divisive, and I like a lot of it… **Strange Beautiful Music** (2002) has some great tracks, but a lot of filler… and after that it all just started to sound the same. I think **Super Colossal** (2006) was the last one I bought, and I absolutely hated it, and swore that I would never go back. After that I would copy or torrent his albums just to check them out, listen to about half of it, and then delete the whole thing. I was *out*. But then, in 2018, something made me check in and have a little listen to Joe’s album that year **What Happens Next**, and I was pretty surprised to find that I liked it. Didn’t love it, it didn’t make the AotY shortlist, but I liked it. OK, fair enough. Then in 2022, Joe blew me and my opinions out of the water with this album **The Elephants of Mars**, and ladies let me tell you this is proper Joe once again. The Joe of old. Experimental Joe, not “here are 7 mid-tempo major-key tunes and a couple of jam songs” Joe. This is his best work since **Crystal Planet** without a doubt. Try it, maybe buy it. I did. **Top track:** “[Sailing the Seas of Ganymede](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ5qpu-O4ws&list=PLY90ZuSuNbRgkUWST4v7vw6wC2C88gnaS&index=26)”
