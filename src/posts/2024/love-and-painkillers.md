Friends, neighbours, ladies, gentlemen, literally anybody who will listen...

I have finished my album.

Let joy be unbounded, let all the peoples of the world finally unite as one, and marvel at the magnificence of one hour of guitar music that took around 20 years to make.

It is called, as I have mentioned once or twice, "**Love and Painkillers**" and its release date is the **2nd of February 2024**, so if you are reading this on or after that date, you can get it right now! Click or tap your wonderful self over to [loveandpainkillers.com](https://loveandpainkillers.com/) and you will find links to various platforms where you can obtain it.

I'm not going to waffle on for 3,000 words like I often do. I just want to mark the fact that what has been a huge project is finally complete, and the music itself will very soon be available. It is finished, it is done, is is complete.

My first album ("**Earthman**", 2002) was a rather amateur-sounding affair, though I was very proud of it at the time and it was the best I could do with the equipment, money and skills I had available to me there and then. In the intervening two decades, the home recording landscape has changed remarkably, and as well as digital amp sims now sounding almost as good as the real thing, we have YouTube tutorials on literally every aspect of every part of every process, including mixing, production, sound design... everything you could ask for. I have availed myself of these and done the best I can, and I think I have made a pretty good record.

So. In the name of not waffling on for 3,000 words, I shall leave it there.

My very great thanks to my friends who played on the record: Nick Beatty, Adrian Clark, Greg Edwards, Jon Ewen, Ian Farrer, John Mitchell and Martin Szomszor (and to my son who played keyboards on one song as well). Thanks to John Mitchell for mastering the album. Huge thanks to the Kickstarter backers who enabled the mastering to happen.

And thanks to you for reading this, and maybe even having a little listen to the album itself.

Go on, it's not much money, and you might like it. I do.
