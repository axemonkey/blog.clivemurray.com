Yeah yeah, supergroups. It’s a mixed bag of hot weasels, really. 

You do get a few that fit the cliché, where they’re a big disappointment and nothing quite works like it should because of all the egos getting in the way, but I struggle to think of any at the moment.

Then you get the “meh” ones where it all sort of works, but doesn’t exactly set the world on fire (*[Chickenfoot](http://www.chickenfoot.us/)*, *[Audioslave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audioslave)*, *[Zwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwan)*, *[Hellyeah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellyeah)*, *[The Winery Dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winery_Dogs)*), you get the ones where it all works really well (*[Velvet Revolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolver)*, *[Brides of Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brides_of_Destruction)*, *[Sons of Apollo](http://www.sonsofapollo.com/)*, *[The Dead Daisies](https://thedeaddaisies.com/)*, *[Frost\*](http://www.frostmusic.net/)*, *[Alter Bridge](https://alterbridge.com/)*, *[The Damned Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Damned_Things)*, *[Flying Colors](http://flyingcolorsmusic.com/)*) and then you get a couple of really rare ones where they are in fact the best thing that’s ever happened (*[David Lee Roth band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_David_Lee_Roth_Band)*[^egos], *[Mr. Big](http://www.mrbigsite.com/)*).

Well, *KXM* are really very good indeed[^category]. Drummer Ray Luzier brings the “K” from *KoRn*, guitarist and friend of the show, the omnipresent hardest-working-rock-star-in-America George Lynch brings the “M” from *Lynch Mob*; and the “X” is lovingly provided by Doug Pinnick – bassist, vocalist and creative powerhouse behind *King’s X*.

With the “super” credentials established and out of the way, and an average age (at time of writing) of 65.667, these are clearly musicians who have been round the block a few times, so does it work when they get together? Is there chemistry? This is, after all, what a band needs to generate music that works, and the lack of which can lead to supergroups ailing, failing and flailing.

It sure does. Doug has such a distinctive sound both on bass and vocals that there was a potential danger of this sounding like a *King’s X* knock-off, but with Lynch on guitar that was never going to happen. I’ve said a thousand times that George has such a distinctive style, you can tell it’s him with one note. How many rock guitarists can you really say that about?[^george] Ray is absolutely excellent on drums, also. I’ve never really dug *KoRn*, but his playing on the *KXM* records is tight and fresh, leaving plenty of room for George to sprinkle his Lynchy noodles.

Best power trio since *Primus*? Controversial… but perhaps… yes? 

Get on it.

## Clive recommends:

All three records are superb. I think for the best balance, as a showcase of what they do, you would be best served starting with 2017’s **[Scatterbrain](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Scatterbrain-Kxm/dp/B01MS4B61P)**, but please do hoover them all up if you dig it.

## Video evidence

[^category]: I shall let you decide which category they belong in.
[^george]: One. It’s George Lynch.
[^egos]: OK, this one did implode because of egos, it’s true. But they put out two of the best rock records ever made before that happened.
