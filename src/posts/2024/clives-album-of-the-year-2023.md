2023 was one of the worst years of my life, and you can take that to the bank. I still don’t know if I will talk about that in public… probably not, as it involves idiocies and failings on my part, and is generally a period I wish to put firmly in my rear view. Suffice to say it was a dark chapter, and it is behind me now. On the positive side, I did play a lot of guitar, finish the writing and recording for [my second solo album](https://loveandpainkillers.com/), and spent a good long time learning about mixing and production. So it wasn’t a total bust.

The [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) continued to decline and the WHO called an end to “[global health emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_emergency_of_international_concern)” status. Huge cyclones and earthquakes killed hundreds of thousands, and continuing wars across the globe claimed perhaps millions more. [Several large American banks imploded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_United_States_banking_crisis), as did [five billionaire dickheads in a tin can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_submersible_implosion). On April 14th, ESA launched the wonderfully named [JUICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moons_Explorer) to look for life around Jupiter, and in further billionaire dickhead news, six days later Space Karen launched [the most powerful rocket ever created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship). It [exploded after four minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_integrated_flight_test_1). This test flight spread sand and soil over communities in a 6.5 mile radius, and caused a brushfire that burned 3.5 acres of state parkland. :*golfclap*:

[Chazzy Tré got his mum’s hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_Charles_III_and_Camilla), Belarus signed an agreement letting Russia station tactical nukes on its territory, which I expect is probably FINE and NOT A PROBLEM, AT ALL. [Greek wildfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Greece_wildfires), [Barbenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbenheimer), [Hawaiian wildfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hawaii_wildfires), Rupert Murdoch retired, [Canadian wildfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Canadian_wildfires), [the Beatles released a new song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_and_Then_(Beatles_song)) despite 50% of them being absolutely dead, and did anyone notice [the world is burning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_temperature_record)?

Among those running down the curtain and joining the choir invisible were [Fay Weldon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fay_Weldon), [Gianluca Vialli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluca_Vialli), [Jeff Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Beck), [Lisa Marie Presley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Marie_Presley), [Julian Sands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Sands), Christopher Light[^chris], [Burt Bacharach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Bacharach), [Raquel Welch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raquel_Welch), [John Motson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Motson), [Mystic Meg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystic_Meg), [Lance Reddick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Reddick), [Lily Savage (Paul O’Grady)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_O%27Grady), [Mary Quant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Quant), [Dame Edna Everage (Barry Humphries)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Humphries), [Harry Belafonte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Belafonte), [Jerry Springer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Springer), [Tina Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Turner), [Silvio Berlusconi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Berlusconi), [Cormac McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy), [Glenda Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenda_Jackson), [Kevin Mitnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick), [Tony Bennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Bennett), [George Alagaih](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Alagiah), [Sinéad O’Connor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O%27Connor), [William Friedkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Friedkin), [Michael Parkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Parkinson), [Molly Holzschlag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Holzschlag)[^molly], [Mike Yarwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Yarwood), [Roger Whittaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Whittaker), [Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McCallum), [Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gambon), [Bobby Charlton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Charlton), [Shaft (Richard Roundtree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Roundtree), [Chanandler Bong (Matt Perry)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Perry), [Charlie Dominici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Dominici), [Joss Ackland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Ackland), [Annabel Giles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabel_Giles), [Terry Venables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Venables), [Shane MacGowan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_MacGowan) and [Benjamin Zephaniah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Zephaniah). 

Honestly. What a load of old shit that year was. I only made it through thanks to some serious help from two very special people (you know who you are). But while all that nonsense was going on, some rather good music was released unto the world.
