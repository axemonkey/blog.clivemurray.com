2023 was one of the worst years of my life, and you can take that to the bank. I still don’t know if I will talk about that in public… probably not, as it involves idiocies and failings on my part, and is generally a period I wish to put firmly in my rear view. Suffice to say it was a dark chapter, and it is behind me now. On the positive side, I did play a lot of guitar, finish the writing and recording for [my second solo album](https://loveandpainkillers.com/), and spent a good long time learning about mixing and production. So it wasn’t a total bust.

The [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) continued to decline and the WHO called an end to “[global health emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_emergency_of_international_concern)” status. Huge cyclones and earthquakes killed hundreds of thousands, and continuing wars across the globe claimed perhaps millions more. [Several large American banks imploded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_United_States_banking_crisis), as did [five billionaire dickheads in a tin can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_submersible_implosion). On April 14th, ESA launched the wonderfully named [JUICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moons_Explorer) to look for life around Jupiter, and in further billionaire dickhead news, six days later Space Karen launched [the most powerful rocket ever created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship). It [exploded after four minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_integrated_flight_test_1). This test flight spread sand and soil over communities in a 6.5 mile radius, and caused a brushfire that burned 3.5 acres of state parkland. :*golfclap*:

[Chazzy Tré got his mum’s hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_Charles_III_and_Camilla), Belarus signed an agreement letting Russia station tactical nukes on its territory, which I expect is probably FINE and NOT A PROBLEM, AT ALL. [Greek wildfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Greece_wildfires), [Barbenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbenheimer), [Hawaiian wildfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hawaii_wildfires), Rupert Murdoch retired, [Canadian wildfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Canadian_wildfires), [the Beatles released a new song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_and_Then_(Beatles_song)) despite 50% of them being absolutely dead, and did anyone notice [the world is burning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_temperature_record)?

Among those running down the curtain and joining the choir invisible were [Fay Weldon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fay_Weldon), [Gianluca Vialli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluca_Vialli), [Jeff Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Beck), [Lisa Marie Presley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Marie_Presley), [Julian Sands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Sands), Christopher Light[^chris], [Burt Bacharach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Bacharach), [Raquel Welch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raquel_Welch), [John Motson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Motson), [Mystic Meg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystic_Meg), [Lance Reddick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Reddick), [Lily Savage (Paul O’Grady)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_O%27Grady), [Mary Quant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Quant), [Dame Edna Everage (Barry Humphries)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Humphries), [Harry Belafonte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Belafonte), [Jerry Springer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Springer), [Tina Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Turner), [Silvio Berlusconi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Berlusconi), [Cormac McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy), [Glenda Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenda_Jackson), [Kevin Mitnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick), [Tony Bennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Bennett), [George Alagiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Alagiah), [Sinéad O’Connor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O%27Connor), [William Friedkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Friedkin), [Michael Parkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Parkinson), [Molly Holzschlag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Holzschlag)[^molly], [Mike Yarwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Yarwood), [Roger Whittaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Whittaker), [Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McCallum), [Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gambon), [Bobby Charlton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Charlton), [Shaft (Richard Roundtree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Roundtree), [Chanandler Bong (Matt Perry)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Perry), [Charlie Dominici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Dominici), [Joss Ackland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Ackland), [Annabel Giles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabel_Giles), [Terry Venables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Venables), [Shane MacGowan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_MacGowan) and [Benjamin Zephaniah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Zephaniah).

Honestly. What a load of old shit that year was. I only made it through thanks to some serious help from two very special people (you know who you are). But while all that nonsense was going on, some rather good music was released unto the world.

## The one-liners

- [*Extreme*](https://extreme-band.com/) – [**Six**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BTDWYZZX). (Rock.) Nuno and friends return with a couple of great singles and a patchy album.
- [*Foo Fighters*](https://foofighters.com/) – [**But Here We Are**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/But-Here-Are-Foo-Fighters/dp/B0C2RW2ZT8). (Rock.) Dave and the gang are back with their first album since the passing of [Taylor Hawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Hawkins). It’s good, like always, with a touch of inevitable extra poignancy.
- [*Greta Van Fleet*](https://gretavanfleet.com/) – [**Starcatcher**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Starcatcher-Greta-Van-Fleet/dp/B0C1JZT82J). (Rock.) Nothing especially new from the retro-focused Michigan quartet, but then, isn’t that largely the point?
- [*George Lynch*](https://georgelynch.com/) – [**Guitars at the End of the World**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Guitars-End-World-George-Lynch/dp/B0CDMFQN5M). (Instrumental rock.) Would you like some George Lynch with that? Yes, you would.
- [*Kylie Minogue*](https://kylie.com/) - [**Tension**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tension-Kylie-Minogue/dp/B0C4Z6BNDJ). (Pop). Another lovely 50mins with Ms. Minogue. Not quite as good as **Disco**, but worth it for “Padam Padam” alone.
- [*Mr. Fastfinger*](https://mrfastfinger.net/) – [**Tremors**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0C1KQRW17). (Instrumental rock.) Terrifying Finn Mika Tyyskä and his fast fingers serving up melodic shred tunage.
- [*Plini*](https://plini.co/) - [**Mirage**](https://plini.bandcamp.com/album/mirage). (Instrumental.) Ol’ Plinners is beginning to go a little more fusiony than I usually like, but I’m still sticking with it. Musicianship *sans pareil*.
- [*Queens of the Stone Age*](https://qotsa.com/) – [**In Times New Roman…**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Times-New-Roman-Queens-Stone/dp/B0C3WS78NX). (Rock.) I can’t quite tell if I like this or not.
- [*Nita Strauss*](https://nitastrauss.com/) – [**Call of the Void**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BZK6WXTD). (Metal.) Nita absolutely shreds, no doubt, but apparently (like Slash and myself) she does not do the singing, so she has recruited some guest warblers here (Alice Cooper, David Draiman and Lzzy Hale among them), plus a smattering of instrumental metal tracks. Inconsistent, but good overall.
- [*Jakub Zytecki*](https://jakubzytecki.bandcamp.com/) – [**Remind Me**](https://jakubzytecki.bandcamp.com/album/remind-me). (Ambient shred.) Lo-fi ambient heavy dream-shred-gaze. I’m coining that here and now. It’s good, also.

OK, ready? Please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times.

## Honourable mentions

### [Black Stone Cherry](https://www.blackstonecherry.com/) - [Screamin’ at the Sky](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Screamin-Sky-Black-Stone-Cherry/dp/B0C4RR66GL)

![Black Stone Cherry – Screamin’ at the Sky](/public/images/2024/11/bsc-screamin.jpg) I first stumbled across *BSC* in around 2008 or so, when their excellent second album **Folklore and Superstition** was doing the rounds. Went to see them play live and everything. Right good, they were. From then onwards I was a little dismayed to see them appear to contract a severe case of what I think of as “Aerosmith Syndrome”. Each album seemed to have a higher percentage of ballads than the previous one, and even the heavier rockier tracks began feeling over-produced and lifeless. I was mightily pleased, then, to check back in with them and discover that this album is much more in keeping with those first couple of records. Smoke ‘em if you got ‘em. **Top track:** “[Screamin’ at the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPmgZhksgjo)”
