2023 was one of the worst years of my life, and you can take that to the bank. I still don’t know if I will talk about that in public… probably not, as it involves idiocies and failings on my part, and is generally a period I wish to put firmly in my rear view. Suffice to say it was a dark chapter, and it is behind me now. On the positive side, I did play a lot of guitar, finish the writing and recording for [my second solo album](https://loveandpainkillers.com/), and spent a good long time learning about mixing and production. So it wasn’t a total bust.

The [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) continued to decline and the WHO called an end to “[global health emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_emergency_of_international_concern)” status. Huge cyclones and earthquakes killed hundreds of thousands, and continuing wars across the globe claimed perhaps millions more. [Several large American banks imploded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_United_States_banking_crisis), as did [five billionaire dickheads in a tin can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_submersible_implosion). On April 14th, ESA launched the wonderfully named [JUICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moons_Explorer) to look for life around Jupiter, and in further billionaire dickhead news, six days later Space Karen launched [the most powerful rocket ever created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship). It [exploded after four minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_integrated_flight_test_1). This test flight spread sand and soil over communities in a 6.5 mile radius, and caused a brushfire that burned 3.5 acres of state parkland. :*golfclap*:

[Chazzy Tré got his mum’s hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_Charles_III_and_Camilla), Belarus signed an agreement letting Russia station tactical nukes on its territory, which I expect is probably FINE and NOT A PROBLEM, AT ALL. [Greek wildfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Greece_wildfires), [Barbenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbenheimer), [Hawaiian wildfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hawaii_wildfires), Rupert Murdoch retired, [Canadian wildfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Canadian_wildfires), [the Beatles released a new song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_and_Then_(Beatles_song)) despite 50% of them being absolutely dead, and did anyone notice [the world is burning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_temperature_record)?

Honestly. What a load of old shit that year was. I only made it through thanks to some serious help from two very special people (you know who you are). But while all that nonsense was going on, some rather good music was released unto the world.

## The one-liners

- [*Extreme*](https://extreme-band.com/) – [**Six**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BTDWYZZX). (Rock.) Nuno and friends return with a couple of great singles and a patchy album.
- [*Foo Fighters*](https://foofighters.com/) – [**But Here We Are**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/But-Here-Are-Foo-Fighters/dp/B0C2RW2ZT8). (Rock.) Dave and the gang are back with their first album since the passing of [Taylor Hawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Hawkins). It’s good, like always, with a touch of inevitable extra poignancy.
- [*Greta Van Fleet*](https://gretavanfleet.com/) – [**Starcatcher**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Starcatcher-Greta-Van-Fleet/dp/B0C1JZT82J). (Rock.) Nothing especially new from the retro-focused Michigan quartet, but then, isn’t that largely the point?
- [*George Lynch*](https://georgelynch.com/) – [**Guitars at the End of the World**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Guitars-End-World-George-Lynch/dp/B0CDMFQN5M). (Instrumental rock.) Would you like some George Lynch with that? Yes, you would.
- [*Kylie Minogue*](https://kylie.com/) - [**Tension**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tension-Kylie-Minogue/dp/B0C4Z6BNDJ). (Pop). Another lovely 50mins with Ms. Minogue. Not quite as good as **Disco**, but worth it for “Padam Padam” alone.
- [*Mr. Fastfinger*](https://mrfastfinger.net/) – [**Tremors**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0C1KQRW17). (Instrumental rock.) Terrifying Finn Mika Tyyskä and his fast fingers serving up melodic shred tunage.
- [*Plini*](https://plini.co/) - [**Mirage**](https://plini.bandcamp.com/album/mirage). (Instrumental.) Ol’ Plinners is beginning to go a little more fusiony than I usually like, but I’m still sticking with it. Musicianship *sans pareil*.
- [*Queens of the Stone Age*](https://qotsa.com/) – [**In Times New Roman…**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Times-New-Roman-Queens-Stone/dp/B0C3WS78NX). (Rock.) I can’t quite tell if I like this or not.
- [*Nita Strauss*](https://nitastrauss.com/) – [**Call of the Void**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BZK6WXTD). (Metal.) Nita absolutely shreds, no doubt, but apparently (like Slash and myself) she does not do the singing, so she has recruited some guest warblers here (Alice Cooper, David Draiman and Lzzy Hale among them), plus a smattering of instrumental metal tracks. Inconsistent, but good overall.
- [*Jakub Zytecki*](https://jakubzytecki.bandcamp.com/) – [**Remind Me**](https://jakubzytecki.bandcamp.com/album/remind-me). (Ambient shred.) Lo-fi ambient heavy dream-shred-gaze. I’m coining that here and now. It’s good, also.

OK, ready? Please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times.

## Honourable mentions

### [Black Stone Cherry](https://www.blackstonecherry.com/) - [Screamin’ at the Sky](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Screamin-Sky-Black-Stone-Cherry/dp/B0C4RR66GL)

![Black Stone Cherry – Screamin’ at the Sky](/public/images/2024/11/bsc-screamin.jpg) I first stumbled across *BSC* in around 2008 or so, when their excellent second album **Folklore and Superstition** was doing the rounds. Went to see them play live and everything. Right good, they were. From then onwards I was a little dismayed to see them appear to contract a severe case of what I think of as “Aerosmith Syndrome”. Each album seemed to have a higher percentage of ballads than the previous one, and even the heavier rockier tracks began feeling over-produced and lifeless. I was mightily pleased, then, to check back in with them and discover that this album is much more in keeping with those first couple of records. Smoke ‘em if you got ‘em. **Top track:** “[Screamin’ at the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPmgZhksgjo)”

### [Buckcherry](http://buckcherry.com/) - [Vol. 10](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vol-10-Buckcherry/dp/B0BW3458BQ)

![Buckcherry – Vol. 10](/public/images/2024/11/bc-vol10.jpg) It’s Josh and the gang’s tenth outing, and you should know what you’re going to get by now. Josh’s voice and Stevie D’s riffage are on point for 37 tight minutes of hard rocking that never leaves you in any doubt. Even the cover of “Summer of ’69” works surprisingly well. Cracking. **Top track:** “Keep On Fighting”

### [Peter Gabriel](https://petergabriel.com/) - [i/o](https://www.amazon.co.uk/i-Peter-Gabriel/dp/B0CJ9TZLYM)

![Peter Gabriel – i/o](/public/images/2024/11/pg-io.jpg) Here’s a chewy one… this is Gabs’s first album of new material since 2002’s excellent **Up**, and yes he has been working on it all that time[^twentyyears]. Gabriel is something of a perfectionist and has been tweaking and meddling with these songs for two decades… for so long in fact that even now, when the album is released, he still couldn’t decide on how the overall mix should sound. For this reason, you get the whole album twice – the same twelve songs in the same order, first in their “Bright-Side Mix” configuration, followed by the “Dark-Side Mix”. Fair enough. It does feel a bit like “Oh… I don’t know… YOU decide! Here, have both versions!” but… you know, this is *Peter Gabriel*. I can forgive him that. For what it’s worth, I prefer the “Dark-Side” overall. It feels a bit more like a cohesive album production than the “Bright-Side” versions. YMMV, of course. What’s in no doubt is septuagenarian Gabriel’s vocal ability. He sounds as good as he ever has (which is very good indeed). **Top track:** “[Four Kinds of Horses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQgct-j6snc)”

### [McRocklin & Hutch](https://mcrocklinhutch.bandcamp.com/) - [Press Start](https://mcrocklinhutch.bandcamp.com/album/press-start)

![McRocklin & Hutch – Press Start](/public/images/2024/11/mch-pressstart.jpg) Thomas McRocklin and Tim Hutchinson absolutely blew me away in [2019](/clives-album-of-the-year-2019/) with their gangbuster shredwave debut **Riding Out** – an absolutely holy marriage of 80s vaporwave retro electronica and blistering lead guitar, and an unabashed homage to 80s rock and cult movies. Does the gag work a second time? Yes, it sure does. Most of the tracks on this second album were released as singles in the wake of **Riding Out**, so if you’re a fan like me, you may already have most of them, but if not then you’re in for another treat. **Top track:** “Distorted Dreams”

### [Metallica](https://metallica.com/) - [72 Seasons](https://www.amazon.co.uk/72-Seasons-Metallica/dp/B0BNJNS3FH)

![Metallica – 72 Seasons](/public/images/2024/11/m-72s.jpg) Cards on the table, I’m not fussed about a lot of *Metallica*’s catalogue. I dig **The Black Album**, I like some tracks off the old stuff, and **St. Anger** was utter tripe. Didn’t much care for **Death Magnetic** either, and I pretty much stopped caring around then. My mate, see, he’s a *’tallica* old-skooler, right. He reckons that **Master of Puppets** is the high-water-mark for Bay Area thrash, and who am I to say he’s wrong? That’s his opinion and he’s welcome to it. Turns out we both like this one, though. Thrashy! **Top track:** “[72 Seasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OeC9CGtWcM)”

### [Nuclear Power Trio](https://www.metalblade.com/us/artists/nuclear-power-trio/) - [Wet Ass Plutonium](https://nuclearpowertrio.bandcamp.com/album/wet-ass-plutonium)

![Nuclear Power Trio – Wet Ass Plutonium](/public/images/2024/11/np3-wap.jpg) It was back in 2020 when this absolutely barking trio dropped their EP **A Clear and Present Rager** and generally dropped jaws all round with their incredible musicianship, wrapped in over-the-top bombast and pomp, and on top of it all shrouding their real identities behind masks[^masks] so that we are presented with what appears to be Trump, Putin and Kim all giving it absolutely six-nowt shred-wise. Novelty, for sure, but the musicality speaks for itself and this is a really fun album even when you aren’t watching the goons in the suits. **Top track:** “[Nyetflix and Chill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MVWtHRrMjM)”

### [Paramore](https://paramoreisaband.com/) - [This Is Why](https://www.amazon.co.uk/This-Why-Paramore/dp/B0BGMSM2YK)

![Paramore – This Is Why](/public/images/2024/11/p-tiw.jpg) *Paramore* are a lot like *DragonForce*, when you think about it. Well, actually no they aren’t at all, but what they do have in common is that my first exposure to them was when playing *Guitar Hero* on my old Xbox 360. I always meant to go back and check out *Paramore* properly, because I very much enjoyed the cut of their jib, but never got around to it until 2023 (some 15 years after their songs appeared in *Guitar Hero: World Tour*). From the moment I put **This Is Why** on to play, I had a smile on my face and I still do whenever it comes up. Lovely album, this. **Top track:** “[Running Out of Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toKJP3luQbI)”

### [The Totemist](https://rabeamassaad.bandcamp.com/) - [Less We Know](https://rabeamassaad.bandcamp.com/album/less-we-know)

![The Totemist – Less We Know](/public/images/2024/11/tt-lwk.jpg) In [2021](/clives-album-of-the-year-2021/) the wonder that is *Rabea Massaad* graced us with a side-project called *The Totemist* and dropped a crushing three-song EP from a great height. It was solid, but brief. This time we get four tracks which are, if anything, even more brootz than last time. Absolute slab. **Top track:** “[Dos Huevos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcKSBkYXKOE)”

### [Voyager](http://voyagerau.com/) - [Fearless in Love](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fearless-Love-Ltd-Digipak-Voyager/dp/B0C43R93BV)

![Voyager – Fearless in Love](/public/images/2024/11/v-fil.jpg) Every time I think about *Voyager* it’s Danny Estrin’s astounding clean vocals that leap to the fore of what I laughably call my mind, but that’s a disservice to the rest of the band and also their songwriting prowess. To my mind no-one does heavy pop-prog as well as this, save perhaps the mighty *Devin Townsend*, which is no faint praise. Also, with *Voyager*, you’re less likely to encounter the sometimes neck-breaking genre shifts that Devin is fond of. You’re in with a pretty good bet that if you like a couple of tracks on a Voyager album, you’ll likely enjoy them all (not something I can confidently say about the undeniably amazing Mr. Townsend). **Top track:** “[Submarine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWrcdYp7W-0)”

### [Steven Wilson](https://stevenwilsonhq.com/) - [The Harmony Codex](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Harmony-Codex-Steven-Wilson/dp/B0CCC8VMHK)

![Steven Wilson – The Harmony Codex](/public/images/2024/11/sw-thc.jpg) I opined back in [2017](/clives-album-of-the-year-2017/) that we are lucky to live in the era of *Steven Wilson*, when he romped home with the top prize for his arresting album **To the Bone**, and I stand by that. The man is a giant of the British prog scene, whether with his band *Porcupine Tree*, his outstanding solo ouvre, or his various side projects. All of this quite aside from being a top-notch producer, mixer and audio engineer, and of late building a reputation for being one of the best remixers/remasterers in the business, specialising in spatial audio remixes. That’s quite a lot of talent for one guy from Hemel Hempstead, really. I personally found his 2021 disc **The Future Bites** to be good, but not as good as I wanted it to be. This heinous crime is rectified here on **The Harmony Codex**, which is fabulous. By turns lush and dense, sparse and haunting, uplifting, and occasionally unsettling. Great stuff, and as always, a guest spot from *Ninet Tayeb* does no harm whatsoever. **Top track:** “[Rock Bottom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRaspkaqR8o)”

### [You Me At Six](http://youmeatsix.co.uk/) - [Truth Decay](https://www.amazon.co.uk/TRUTH-DECAY-YOU-ME-SIX/dp/B0BJLPPKTR)
