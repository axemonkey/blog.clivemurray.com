The hardest part of starting a new band has always been coming up with a cool name. Nowadays it's even harder since you need to come up with a name that has an available .com domain. If you have to add "online" or "rocks" to the end of your band's name to get the domain, you haven't put enough work into it.

Here's a chronological list of all the bands I've been in over the last 23 years:

- Shockwave
- Sister Steele
- NSK
- Pegasus
- Ugly Seed
- May 19
- Chameleon
- Strange Machine
- Iguanahead
- The Clive Murray Band
- [Claytown Troupe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claytown_Troupe)
- [Little Monkeys](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Live-The-Marquee-Little-Monkeys/dp/B00350WWU8)
- Crashstars (which was Little Monkeys renamed)
- [Indigo Down](http://indigodown.com/)
