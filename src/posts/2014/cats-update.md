Ok, so when [last I spoke about feline friends](__GHOST_URL__/incoming/), my wife and I had just adopted four new sets of paws - a mummy cat and her three kittens.

Well, that was three months ago, and they have settled in marvellously. The kittens have grown lots, they no longer feed from their mum, they can all go outside and have all been spayed/neutered, and are generally having a splendid time of it all.

Here's Cleo looking fabulous in the kitchen:
