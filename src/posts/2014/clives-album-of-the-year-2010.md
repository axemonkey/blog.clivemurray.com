2010 was the year in which I got married, the [Burj Khalifa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Khalifa) opened, [Ronnie James Dio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_James_Dio) and [Leslie Nielsen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Nielsen) died, and Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon went on [The Trip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trip_%282010_TV_series%29).

New-releases-wise it was a cracking year for metal ([*The Damned Things*](http://www.thedamnedthings.com/), [*Triosphere*](http://www.thetriosphere.com/), [*Hellyeah*](http://www.hellyeahband.com/), [*Furyon*](http://www.furyon.net/), [*Grand Magus*](http://www.grandmagus.com/), [*Star One*](http://www.arjenlucassen.com/content/arjens-projects/star-one/), [*Alter Bridge*](http://www.alterbridge.com/), [*Iron Maiden*](http://www.ironmaiden.com/), [*John 5*](http://www.john-5.com/)), folk metal ([*Blind Guardian*](http://www.blind-guardian.com/), [*Orphaned Land*](http://www.orphaned-land.com/), [*Amorphis*](http://amorphis.net/), [*Wuthering Heights*](http://www.wuthering-heights.dk/), [*Eluveitie*](http://eluveitie.ch/), [*Heljareyga*](http://www.heljareyga.fo/)), prog ([*Coheed and Cambria*](http://www.coheedandcambria.com/), [*Myrath*](http://www.myrath.com/)), rock ([*Hardcore Superstar*](http://www.hardcoresuperstar.com/), [*Slash*](http://slashonline.com/), [*My Chemical Romance*](http://www.mychemicalromance.com/), [*Airbourne*](http://www.airbournerock.com/), [*Buckcherry*](http://www.buckcherry.com/), [*You Me At Six*](http://www.youmeatsix.co.uk/), [*Ratt*](http://www.therattpack.com/), [*Crashdïet*](http://www.crashdiet.org/)), dance ([*Daft Punk*](http://www.daftpunk.com/), [*Underworld*](http://www.underworldlive.com/), [*Deadmau5*](http://www.deadmau5.com/), [*Pendulum*](http://www.pendulum.com/)) and pop ([*Angels & Airwaves*](http://www.angelsandairwaves.com/), [*Johnny Flynn*](http://www.johnny-flynn.com/), [*Cee-Lo Green*](http://www.ceelogreen.com/)).

## Honourable mentions

### [Cloudkicker](http://cloudkickermusic.com/) - [Beacons](http://cloudkickermusic.com/album/beacons)

![Cloudkicker – Beacons](/public/images/2020/05/cloudkicker_beacons.jpeg){.aoty .aoty-mention} *Cloudkicker* is the recording monicker of one Ben Sharp, and aside from that not a great deal more is known. He's a one-man show that creates wonderful music, and pretty much gives it away - which in the end is probably as much as you need to know. Great stuff. **Top track:** "Oh, god."

### [The Damned Things](http://www.thedamnedthings.com/) - [Ironiclast](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ironiclast-The-Damned-Things/dp/B0047A87OK)

![The Damned Things – Ironiclast](/public/images/2020/05/the-damned-things_ironiclast.jpeg){.aoty .aoty-mention} I know nothing about *Fall Out Boy*, *Every Time I Die*, or *Volbeat*, which puts me at a disadvantage here as I am unfamiliar with the work of 5 out of 6 of the members of this metal supergroup. The one member I do know is Scott Ian of *Anthrax*, and it was on his presence alone that I took a gamble on this album. It's bloody excellent. **Top track:** "Bad Blood"

### [Eluveitie](http://eluveitie.ch/) - [Everything Remains As It Never Was](http://www.amazon.com/Everything-Remains-As-Never-Was/dp/B002ZCD8Z0)

![Eluveitie – Everything Remains As It Never Was](/public/images/2020/05/eluveitie_everything-remains-as-it-never-was.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention} Power metal riffs, death metal vocals, penny whistles and hurdy-gurdies. Smashing. **Top track:** "Thousandfold"

### [My Chemical Romance](http://www.mychemicalromance.com/) - [Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Danger-Days-Lives-Fabulous-Killjoys/dp/B0044KU7KU)

![My Chemical Romance – Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys](/public/images/2020/05/my-chemical-romance_danger-days.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention} No, shut up. Shut your hole, dammit. I know you, and you were thinking about saying something like "But aren't they emo?" Stop it. This is a fantastic album of pop/rock tunes, and even if the pseudo-post-apocalyptic concept schtick can feel a little forced, songs like "Sing", "Summertime", "The Kids From Yesterday", and the sublime "The Only Hope For Me Is You" are proof that *MCR* were never some sub-genre fad, but a damned decent rock band. Shame this was their last album, as it turned out. **Top track:** "The Kids From Yesterday"

### [Pendulum](http://www.pendulum.com/) - [Immersion](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Immersion-Pendulum/dp/B003GEDLW6)

![Pendulum – Immersion](/public/images/2020/05/pendulum_immersion.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention} I'd not heard of *Pendulum* before this, but when I did I loved them. An excellent mix of drum 'n' bass styles and real instruments, plus some cracking tunes. Lovely stuff. **Top track:** "Crush"

## And the winner is...

### [Furyon](http://www.furyon.net/) - [Gravitas](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gravitas-Furyon/dp/B006ZEZ4F6)
![Furyon - Gravitas](/public/images/2020/05/furyon_gravitas.jpg){.aoty .aoty-winner}
Good god, yes. These metallers from Brighton are yet to achieve the recognition they deserve, in my opinion. I hadn't had my socks so completely rocked off since hearing **Images and Words** back in 1992 or so. This is some properly hooky metal, with grooves and riffs like you wouldn't believe, and oh my days, the guitar solos... Personally I cannot wait for the followup album, but in the meantime stick **Gravitas** on, pin back your ears, and do nothing else for 55 minutes. You can thank me later.

**Top tracks:** "Disappear Again", "Voodoo Me", "Souvenirs"
