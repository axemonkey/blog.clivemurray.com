excerpt: On millennium night I played a covers gig in Hastings, where for the first half we partied like it was 1999, because it was. And then it wasn't. But we carried on anyway.

In Summer 1999 I met a girl. We hooked up for a bit and it didn’t really work out. But then in Autumn I met another girl. We hooked up and 15 years later I’m proud to call her my wife. :)

[The Sopranos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos) and [Family Guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Guy) both debuted on US television, [Melissa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_worm) "attacked the internet", the [Columbine massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre) happened, [Jill Dando](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Dando) was shot dead on her doorstep, [The Phantom Menace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_The_Phantom_Menace) um… happened, [Napster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster) debuted, we had a [total solar eclipse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_11,_1999) which I peered at through the clouds on a rooftop in Soho, having landed my first London job, Apple released the G4 and Sega released the Dreamcast.

It was thank you and goodnight to (among, as always, many others) [Dusty Springfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Springfield), [Stanley Kubrick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick), [Yehudi Menuhin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehudi_Menuhin), [Little Ern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Wise), [Dirk Bogarde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Bogarde), [Bones (DeForest Kelly)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeForest_Kelley), [Q (Desmond Llewelyn)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Llewelyn), [Screaming Lord Sutch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screaming_Lord_Sutch) and the mighty, mighty [Oliver Reed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Reed).

On millennium night I played a covers gig in Hastings, where for the first half we partied like it was 1999, because it was. And then it wasn't. But we carried on anyway.

## Honourable mentions

### [Buckcherry](http://www.buckcherry.com/) - [Buckcherry](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Buckcherry/dp/B00000IGQU/)

![Buckcherry – Buckcherry](/public/images/2025/02/buckcherry-buckcherry.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention} I've written much about *Buckcherry* as it is, but this was their debut album. I missed it at the time and came to it later, and still to this day prefer the followup **Time Bomb**, but this is still a righteous rocking album. Proper raw rock and roll. **Top track:** "Lawless And Lulu"

### [Ludovico Einaudi](http://www.ludovicoeinaudi.com/) - [Eden Roc](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eden-Roc-Einaudi/dp/B001HQTEYO/)

![Ludovico Einaudi – Eden Roc](/public/images/2025/02/einaudi-edenroc.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention} I've only quite recently discovered the minimalist stylings of *Ludo*, but when I heard him on Classic FM I rushed out and bought just about everything of his I could find. Minimal classical, nothing too challenging, perhaps a little anodyne for some, but I love it. **Top track:** "Due Tramonti"

### [Powerman 5000](http://www.powerman5000.com/) - [Tonight The Stars Revolt!](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tonight-Stars-Revolt-Powerman-5000/dp/B00000JMXV/)

![Powerman 5000 – Tonight The Stars Revolt!](/public/images/2025/02/pm5k-stars.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention} No idea where I first heard "Nobody's Real" but when I did it made me want more, and this is such a cracking album. Snarly punk-industrial-metal (nu, perhaps… shudder…) and great fun throughout. **Top track:** "Nobody's Real"

### [Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://redhotchilipeppers.com/) - [Californication](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00000J7JO)

![Red Hot Chili Peppers – Californication](/public/images/2025/02/rhcp-cali.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention} This was the *Chilis*' first studio album in four years, and marked the return of John Frusciante on the six-string twangplank. It remains their best-selling album ever, though for my money it's slightly bettered by [2002](/clives-album-of-the-year-2002/)'s **By The Way**. Still great though. **Top track:** "Scar Tissue"

### [Stereophonics](http://www.stereophonics.com/) - [Performance and Cocktails](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Performance-Cocktails-Stereophonics/dp/B00000ILO7/)

![Stereophonics – Performance and Cocktails](/public/images/2025/02/stereophonics-perf-cock.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention} The *'phonics* were everywhere in 1999. You couldn't move for "The Bartender and the Thief", "Just Looking" and "Pick a Part That's New", and that was because they're ace songs. The rest of the album is just as great, if not greater. **Top track:** "Pick A Part That's New"

## And the winner is…

### [Underworld](http://www.underworldlive.com/) - [Beaucoup Fish](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beaucoup-Fish-Underworld/dp/B000023Y31/)

![Underworld - Beaucoup Fish](/public/images/2018/03/u.jpg){.aoty .aoty-winner}

King of Snake, King of Snake.

Tina lives in Berlin, her voice so seldom on my machine.

Etc.

Again, I was late to the **Underworld** party, but my mate trying hard to get me to listen to something that didn't at least feature a fast lead guitarist must have finally broken through because one day I saw the light. I won't lie to you, alcohol probably played a part. This is *splendid* music to get at least partially off your ordinary face to. In fact I think I'd been listening to this album for a number of years before I realised that the lyrics to "Push Upstairs" and "Push Downstairs" are the same, and that one is a downtempo moody version of the other. Which is quite clever, though I obviously wasn't.

Intelligent, dancey electronica that isn't afraid to go dark occasionally all carried along by Karl Hyde's swirling stream-of-consciousness lyrics.

And, to quote Rufus (from [Bill & Ted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Ted%27s_Excellent_Adventure)), it's *excellent* for dancing.

**Top tracks:** "Push Upstairs", "King Of Snake", "Cups"

## Turkey of the Year

### [Mr. Big](http://www.mrbigsite.com/) - [Get Over It](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Get-Over-Mr-Big/dp/B00002DEPB/)

![Mr. Big – Get Over It](/public/images/2025/02/mrbig-getoverit.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention .aoty-turkey}

Oh dear. For me **Mr. Big** needed Paul Gilbert's sense of humour running through their music to make it listenable, and his replacement Richie Kotzen - while an absolutely incredible musician - is pretty po-faced, and the band lost something vital at this point.
