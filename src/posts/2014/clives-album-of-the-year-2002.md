2002 was the first palindromic year since 1991 and the last until 2112. It started on a Tuesday, which was the day [the Euro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro) first became legal tender.

2002 marked [Q-Tip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II)'s [Golden Jubilee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II) on February 6th, though her sister - Princess Margaret - died from a stroke in her sleep three days later, and The Queen Mother died in March. Mixed fortunes for the Windsors there, then.

[A new insect order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantophasmatodea) was discovered, BT Cellnet rebranded as O2, Brazil won [the World Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup_Final), central Europe [flooded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_European_floods) and Dubya gave birth to [the Department of Homeland Security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security).

We lost (as always, among many others) [Chuck Jones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Jones), [Spike Milligan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Milligan) (turns out he *was* ill), [Dudley Moore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudley_Moore), [Layne Staley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layne_Staley), [Thor Heyerdahl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_Heyerdahl), [Linda Lovelace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Lovelace), [John Entwhistle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Entwistle), [Richard Harris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Harris_(actor)), [Jam-Master Jay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam-Master_Jay), [James Coburn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Coburn) and [Joe Strummer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Strummer).

2002 is also the name of a [new age band from Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_%28band%29).

## Honourable mentions

### [A](http://www.acommunication.co.uk/) - [Hi-Fi Serious](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hi-Fi-Serious/dp/B00006349V/)

![A – Hi-Fi Serious](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/a_hifi-serious.jpg) The least web-search-compatible band in the world, *A* had released two albums before this but my advice is to skip them - the songs and the production don't come anywhere near close to matching this cracker. Punchy as hell and great fun throughout. **Top track:** "Nothing"

### [Freak Kitchen](http://www.freakkitchen.com/) - [Move](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Move-Freak-Kitchen/dp/B00008XVHY/)

![Freak Kitchen – Move](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/freak-kitchen_move.jpg) In 2002 I became aware of many of my guitarist friends suddenly raving about this Swedish guy called [*Mattias Eklundh*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattias_Eklundh). I found his first solo album mind-blowing and impenetrable in equal measure, but when I heard his band this album became an instant favourite. Clever, sometimes heavy, always interesting. **Top track:** "Nobody's Laughing"

### [Paul Gilbert](http://www.paulgilbert.com/) - [Burning Organ](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Burning-Organ-Paul-Gilbert/dp/B000084IP7/)

![Paul Gilbert – Burning Organ](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/paul-gilbert_burning-organ.jpg) I've always dug *PG*'s solo albums, though due to his self-confessed "pop voice" they are sometimes a little ballad-laden. This one rocks out though - it even starts with a track called "I Like Rock".  **Top track:** "My Religion"

### [Porcupine Tree](http://www.porcupinetree.com/) - [In Absentia](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Absentia-European-Porcupine-Tree/dp/B00007J36G/)

![Porcupine Tree – In Absentia](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/porcupine-tree_in-absentia.jpg) During my time in advertising, I made one of the best friends of my life - Mr [Mathias Hellquist](http://imakethingswork.com/) - and it was he who introduced me to this album, which proved to be a gateway drug to the whole *Porcupine Tree* back catalogue. This one is for my money the pinnacle of the oeuvre, though that may be because I haven't spent enough time with its successors. Either way, it's magnificent. **Top track:** "Blackest Eyes"

### [Red Hot Chili Peppers](http://www.redhotchilipeppers.com/) - [By The Way](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Way-Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers/dp/B000067CPX/)

![Red Hot Chili Peppers – By The Way](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/red-hot-chilli-peppers_by-the-way.jpg) You could not move for this album in 2002-2004 or so. You know why? It's *good*. **Top track:** "Can't Stop"

## And the winner is…

### [Damien Rice](http://www.damienrice.com) - [O](http://www.amazon.co.uk/O-Damien-Rice/dp/B0000AXKRB/)
![Damien Rice - O](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/damien-rice_o.jpeg)
Oh god, this album.

It took me a while to get down into it, having been played it a few times at a friend's flat, but a few more repeat listens and a heart-rending live gig at the Union Chapel later and I was a *Damien Rice* convert. This album…

This album.

I find it hard to even write about, since I often find it hard to listen to. And I find it hard to listen to purely because if I actually pay attention to it (as opposed to, say, having it in my headphones while working) then I find it drags me on an emotional roller-coaster journey that frankly wears me out. I know music is *supposed* to do that, that's generally *the idea*. But the epic trek comprised of these ten tracks demands a lot of the listener. Don't get me wrong, it's not challenging music - it's just… **deep**. I think. I could be wrong.

I'll say this - go with it. You'll get back at least as much as you put in, though you might end up a little different by the end.

**Top tracks:** "The Blower's Daughter", "Amie", "Cannonball"

## Turkey of the Year

### [Rush](http://www.rush.com/) - [Vapor Trails](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Vapor-Trails-Rush/dp/B000065DTE/)

Bleurch. Honestly. Wow. No. Don't do that.
