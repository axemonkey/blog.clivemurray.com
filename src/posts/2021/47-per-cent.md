excerpt: I’m proud that I can hold up a shrinkwrapped CD with a barcode on it and say, “That’s my album. I wrote that.”
---

A long time ago I released an album. (I play guitar, you know.) It was recorded with the limited equipment I had at the time, and with the limited skill and patience I had at the time.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m proud of [Earthman](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/earthman/275368059). I’m proud that it got made at all, and thankful to the backers who chipped in to get the CDs pressed and who I never did manage to pay back.

I’m proud that I can hold up a shrinkwrapped CD with a barcode on it and say, “That’s my album. I wrote that.” Very proud, and very grateful to all those who helped it happen.

But, that was 2002. Since then the home recording landscape has transformed unimaginably, and during a profitable period of work I availed myself of non-pirated decent recording software (Logic) and all the plugins I could eat. I even bought [a decent bass](/guitars/#ibanezsr705nt2009).

And? Well. I’ve been promising a second album for well over a decade now, but you know what? As always, life gets in the way. In that time I changed jobs many times, got married, left London, had a child, joined and formed many bands, bought a house, and... well... aged 20 years. I also stopped playing for long periods of time.

But at the start of 2020 (before the lockdowns) I started a regular music night. A regular slot, ringfenced and sacred in the calendar, that is for working on music projects. And so, once the [Indigo Down](https://indigodown.com/) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAFhv4xKi0c) and [EP](https://indigodown.com/release) were out, my focus shifted back to one of the projects on the shelf, namely album 2.

To spur me on and motivate me, I decided to create a small website which shows the progress I’m making on it. I’m not sure why – perhaps if my progress is visible, then there’s more impetus to keep making visible progress? Something like that.

Anyway. [It’s going to be called Love & Painkillers, and it’s 47% complete](https://loveandpainkillers.com/). I am very much hoping to get it released some time in 2022, time and... *gestures wildly* all *this...* allowing.

Peace and love, and good happiness stuff. 🙏
