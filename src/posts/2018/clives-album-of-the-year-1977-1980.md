On we go, come on come on, keep up, I haven't got all day, you know.

# 1980

## Honourable mention

### [Van Halen](http://www.van-halen.com/) - [Women and Children First](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Women-Children-First-Remastered-Halen/dp/B00UZTTHTG/)

![Van Halen - Women and Children First](/public/images/2025/02/vh-women.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention} When *Van Halen* burst onto the scene they undeniably took it apart (more on that later), and they were still pretty much at the top of their game by the third album. Punchy. **Top track**: "Everybody Wants Some!!"

## Winner

### [AC/DC](http://www.acdc.com/) - [Back in Black](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Back-Black-AC-DC/dp/B00O6YCV80/)

Well. I know I'm going to get into trouble in some quarters, but for me *AC/DC* has a Geordie singer with a flat cap. I know, I know, and all you O.G. Bon Scott loving fans can go right ahead and tell me how wrong I am, but I'll just smile and stick this album on again. Of course it's a tragedy how BS died, of course he was taken too early, naturally he was a huge part of how the band achieved their success to begin with. I'm not arguing with any of that. But for me, this is THE *AC/DC* album, and no amount of "Beating Around the Bush", "Big Balls" or "TNT" is going to change that.

**Top tracks:** "Hells Bells", "You Shook Me All Night Long", "Back in Black"

# 1979

## Honourable mentions

### [AC/DC](http://www.acdc.com/) - [Highway to Hell](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Highway-Hell-AC-DC/dp/B00O71X5YG/)

![AC/DC - Highway to Hell](/public/images/2025/02/hth.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention} Now that's not to say that I don't like Bon Scott, by the way… I just prefer Johnson. But on this, Scott's final album, he was pretty damned amazing and Angus is absolutely out of control. **Top track**: "Highway to Hell"

### [Van Halen](http://www.van-halen.com/) - [Van Halen II](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Van-Halen-II/dp/B00UZTWEVO/)

![Van Halen - Van Halen II](/public/images/2025/02/vhii.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention} Ah, *Van Halen*, you say? Well yes. Their second album has some crackers on it, and the musical pyrotechnics of EVH are if anything a little more harnessed than on the debut. Just a little filler here, but mostly killer. **Top track**: "Light Up the Sky"

## Winner

### [Pink Floyd](http://www.pinkfloyd.com/) - [The Wall](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wall-2011-Remastered-Version/dp/B005NNYL54/)

So you thought you might like to go to the show?

If you're going to concept album, this is how you do it. (I'm looking at you, *Dream Theater*.) An introvert odyssey into isolation and what boils down to PTSD and depression, this 81-minute cheery tale of one young man's breakdown and consequent regression inside himself is a prog masterpiece, one of the few of the era that I can actually tolerate, laden as it is with drama and melody from the get-go. Total boner-fido classic, and the only example that comes to mind of a justifiable double album. Go on, name *one* other (discounting live albums and soundtracks) that wouldn't be better boiled down to a single album… You can't. But this is worth every second.

**Top tracks:** "Comfortably Numb", "Mother", "Another Brick in the Wall pt. 2"

# 1978

## Honourable mentions

### [Dire Straits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dire_Straits) - [Dire Straits](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dire-Straits-Remastered/dp/B001KVLPMK/)

![Dire Straits - Dire Straits](/public/images/2025/02/ds-ds.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention} This may in fact be my favourite *Dire Straits* album. There's a prowling moodiness to the lyrics and Mark Knopfler's lead guitar crackles throughout. "Sultans of Swing" indeed. **Top track**: "Down to the Waterline"

### [Brian Eno](http://www.brian-eno.net/) - [Ambient 1: Music for Airports](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ambient-Music-Airports-Brian-Eno/dp/B001I3DUQO/)

![Brian Eno - Ambient 1: Music for Airports](/public/images/2025/02/airports.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention} Ambient music is not for everyone, but if it is even mildly your bag then you need this. High water mark. **Top track**: "1/1"

## Winner

### [Van Halen](http://www.van-halen.com/) - [Van Halen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Van-Halen/dp/B00UZTL04Q/)

![Van Halen - Van Halen](/public/images/2018/01/Van_Halen_300.jpg){.aoty .aoty-winner}

Are you kidding me? I frequently wax lyrical about the greatest debut album of all time being **Appetite For Destruction** in 1987, which it is, but this has to be right behind it.

I can't imagine being the rock music industry when this thing hit it. I imagine it must have had to go and have a bit of a lie down.

**Top tracks:** "Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love", "Atomic Punk", "Runnin' With the Devil"

# 1977

## Dishonourable mention

### [The Sex Pistols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Pistols) - [Never Mind the Bollocks…](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Never-Mind-Bollocks-Heres-Pistols/dp/B00860FD9O/)

![The Sex Pistols - Never Mind the Bollocks…](/public/images/2025/02/bollocks.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention} I was never into punk, not even a little bit, but it definitely happened, of that much we can be sure. It transpires that this is actually pretty good, even now. **Top track**: "Pretty Vacant"

## Winner

### [Fleetwood Mac](https://www.fleetwoodmac.com/) - [Rumours](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rumours-Fleetwood-Mac/dp/B00AI3UW2K/)

![Fleetwood Mac - Rumours](/public/images/2018/01/rsz_rumours.jpg){.aoty .aoty-winner}

Retroactively, for sure, though many of the *Mac* tracks I grew up loving seem to have come from this album, so why not? [Wikipedia tells me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumours_(album)) that following the previous eponymous album the band's two couples – Christine & John McVie and Buckingham/Nicks – had split up (as well as drummer Mick Fleetwood going through a divorce of his own), lending a certain frisson to the writing process for this, later claimed to be their most important album of all time (and the band's 11th overall).

Whether you have any time for *Fleetwood Mac* or not, they were one of the bigger bands of this era and I grew up with many of these songs on the radio, and I still love them. So there.

**Top tracks**: "Dreams", "Go Your Own Way", "The Chain"
