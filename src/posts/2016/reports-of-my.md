...etc etc.

You know how it is. Blogging comes and goes in phases. I used to be pretty prolific â€“ hell I was doing this in 1998 before the word blogging existed, and we had to phone up the web server and shout the 1s and 0s down the line.

I'm well, my family are well, things are all OK. That's what really matters.

I'll be back sometime, when there's time.
