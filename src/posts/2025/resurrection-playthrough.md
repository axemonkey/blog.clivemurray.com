It has been a while before I came before you with anything new, aside from belching thousands of words at you and calling it "Album of the Year".

And so, here I am with a fresh guitar performance (recorded yesterday in fact) of... a short tune I released 23 years ago.

Back in April I was jumping around and getting all excited because [a new guitar project](/guitar-challenges/) had emerged. That went fine for a bit, but it has stalled now and I would say it is on hiatus. I hope that it might re-emerge sometime, but it's on pause for the time being.

The reason I was so excited about that project was it gave me a reason to play guitar. When left to my own devices, and with no project on the go, I stagnate. I gravitate away from my guitars and towards my [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/play/user/Ax3m0nk3y), and I was putting in some *fierce* hours on **Fallout 4**. Then lo and behold, we had the idea for the Challenges project and that was that. I put the controller down, and got back into shape on guitar. For a couple of months back in the spring I was back up to peak fitness, ripping solos and whole songs at a fearless pace. But when it ground to a halt over the summer, I drifted back to the sofa and slipped back into lassitude.

What to do instead, then? Well, in between trying to get all the achievements in **Assassin's Creed II** I had an idea. How about recording some playthrough videos of my own solo material? I know most of the steps, and I own the copyright, so there should be no impediment. Hurrah! A reason to play again!

> Capital idea, Murray. Get on with it then.

I have, actually. I started softly with a playthrough of the short piece "Resurrection" from my first album, **Earthman** (2002).

Here it be:

I'm planning on doing more, though frequency will be determined by available spare time.

Is that the sort of thing you want?
