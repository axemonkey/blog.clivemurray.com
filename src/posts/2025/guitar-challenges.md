## New thing alert!

There's this guy, you know?

He and I have been playing guitar in bands together since we were 17, right up until the point in the late 2000s where he selfishly left the country and started a family or some such thing.

Despite that, we're still buddies and we still talk all the time. But, thanks to our old friend geography, we don't get to jam any more. This made us sad.

But a couple of months ago we hit upon a great idea – we would think up guitar challenges for each other. Songs or solos that either we used to play back in the day, or would like to spend a bit of time on. Then, each week[^week], we select one from the list, learn or re-learn it, video the evidence, and stick it up on the YooToobs.

Natty, yes? In fact we have been doing this for a little while now, and two challenges have been completed, a third is imminent, and I've been beavering away on the fourth.

Naturally, being of a webbish mindset, I turned this little project into its own website, and so with no further ado, I present to you:

Enjoy!

Feel free to leave comments, suggestions, critiques, and fan-mail, but just remember this isn't a competition. We're doing it for the joy of doing it. (Also, he's better than me, but that's by the bye.)


[^week]: Ideally, each week. But you know, life gets in the way. We're lagging a bit at the moment, plus some of these things are harder than others.
