So, having successfully recorded a playthrough video for my short piece "Resurrection", the next logical step was to try and do a full-length song.

I had a bit of a think about which one to do and decided on "Kalahari" off of **[Love and Painkillers](https://clivemurray.bandcamp.com/album/love-and-painkillers)** (2024), since I've been playing it for about 30 years and I can remember most of the notes. I even asked the internet (via Mastadon and Instagram) which guitar I should use, and the green Jem won.

> 30 years? But it only came out last year!

Well yes. When I rushed **Earthman** out in 2002 I didn't record all the songs I had written, and this was one that has hung around ever since the mid-90s waiting for a proper treatment. It got that, in my opinion, and it's one of my most fun songs to play. 😀

Enough waffle, here is the video (which also contains some waffle, though mercifully at the end):

I hope to do more, as time allows. Please enjoy!
