## The one-liners

- [*Sebastian Bach*](https://www.sebastianbach.com/) – [**Child Within the Man**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Child-WIthin-Man-Sebastian-Bach/dp/B0CY3BXR8N). (Rock.) The former *Skid Row* screamjouster returns after a ten-year hiatus with a hard rocking album, sprinkled with guest guitar spots from the likes of John 5, Orianthi and Steve Stevens. Not flawless, but very good.
- [*Jerry Cantrell*](https://www.jerrycantrell.com/) – [**I Want Blood**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/I-Want-Blood-Jerry-Cantrell/dp/B0DFCBVT27). (Rock.) Head plank-molester for *Alice in Chains*, Jerry brings us another solo outing. Sounds quite like *Alice in Chains*, as it goes.
- [*Frost\**](https://frost.life/) – [**Life in the Wires**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Wires-Frost/dp/B0DD6ZY7ZK). (Proggy rock. Or rocky prog, I suppose.) Messrs Godfrey, Mitchell, Blundell and King return with their fifth full-length long player. Cracking stuff.
- [*Intervals*](https://intrvls.com/) – [**Memory Palace**](https://intervalsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/memory-palace). (Instrumental metal.) Aaron Marshall with another tightly conceived block of instru-metal. As great as it is, they are all starting to sound pretty samey.
- [*Dua Lipa*](https://dualipa.com/) - [**Radical Optimism**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Radical-Optimism-Limited-Lenticular-CD/dp/B0CXDXW5LV). (Pop). I adored Ms. Lipa's previous album **Future Nostalgia**, and while there's nothing wrong with this one, it doesn't quite grab me the same way. "French Exit" is fab though.
- [*Rabea Massaad*](https://rabeamassaad.bandcamp.com) – [**Grinding Gears Vol. 4**](https://rabeamassaad.bandcamp.com/album/grinding-gears-vol-4). (Instrumental metal.) The fourth instalment of Rabea's gear demo tunes is the heaviest and best yet. Can the man do no wrong?
- [*Mr. Big*](https://www.mrbigsite.com/) - [**Ten**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ten-Mr-Big/dp/B0D2JFG16X). (Rock). If I'm honest, I only really care about the first three—maybe two—*Mr. Big* albums, but this here is their final one. So, there's that.
- [*Clive Murray*](https://clivemurray.com/) - [**Love and Painkillers**](https://clivemurray.bandcamp.com/album/love-and-painkillers). (Instrumental rock). Ahem. Yes. Look, it took me twenty years, and I finally finished it and released it. Sue me for being proud of that.
- [*Pet Shop Boys*](https://petshopboys.co.uk/) - [**Nonetheless**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/nonetheless-Deluxe-2CD-Shop-Boys/dp/B0CTKKBBVF). (Pop). Neil and Chris are still doing it, and they still sound great.
- [*dUg Pinnick*](https://www.dugnation.net/) - [**Thingamajigger**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thingamajigger-Dug-Pinnick/dp/B0DJ1HWVZH). (Rock). Chief bass-botherer off of *King's X* dUg brings us a solo record to tide us over until the next *KXM* album.
- [*Taylor Swift*](https://www.taylorswift.com/) - [**The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tortured-Poets-Department-Anthology/dp/B0DNNG5RSM). (Pop). I like Taylor, and I don't care who knows it. Not as mesmerising as **Midnights**, not as intimate as **Folklore** or **Evermore**, and could probably stand to lose a couple of tracks. Still great though.
- [*Týr*](https://tyr.fo/) - [**Battle Ballads**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Battle-Ballads-T-r/dp/B0CV1CWZGD). (Folk Metal). The Faroese metallers are still going after a few lineup changes and their ninth album is exactly what you might expect. If you like them, you'll like this.
- [*Whom Gods Destroy*](https://wgdestroy.com/) - [**Insanium**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Insanium-Whom-Gods-Destroy/dp/B0CPB3G8NH). (Prog Metal). I wanted this to be as good as **Sons of Apollo**, but it's not quite. Nothing wrong with it though, and if you like Sherinian or Thal you'll love it. Dino Jelusick (vocals) is one to watch for sure.
