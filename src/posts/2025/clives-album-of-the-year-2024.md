2024 was a year. I expect *some* good things happened, but in the main it was not zesty.

Many major armed conflicts continued in many places including [Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine), [Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_civil_war_(2021%E2%80%93present)), [Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_civil_war_(2023%E2%80%93present)), [the Sahel region of West Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamist_insurgency_in_the_Sahel) and [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war), as well as [the ongoing war in Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war). Sweden joined NATO and Bulgaria and Romania joined [Schengen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area). [Northern America saw a total solar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_April_8,_2024), and [a G5-rated series of solar storms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2024_solar_storms) led to the aurorae (both Borealis and Australis) to be seen much further from the poles than usual, including right over my back garden in Hemel Hempstead. FACT. P45 was [found guilty on 34 counts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_in_New_York), and we thought that would be the last we'd see of him. Hah. Then someone [shot him in the ear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Pennsylvania). [CrowdStrike knackered up a lot of Windows computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike_incident), the knock-on effects bringing down airlines, banks, government services and more across the world. This also made it difficult for punters to buy beer at [the festival I was playing](https://hoodstock.rocks) that day, so boo. In an unusually positive move, the UK became the first G7 country to [phase out coal power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_phase-out). The [Europa Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Clipper) was sent to Europa, Jupiter's moon. (Hopefully **not** to [attempt a landing](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/992255-all-these-worlds-are-yours-except-europa-attempt-no-landing).) The UK got its first Labour government[^starmer] since 2005, P45 got re-elected[^trump], and many countries around the world tilted further and further to the political right, about which I am **very much not OK**. I try to keep politics out of these intros, but damn, it's hard. Alright what else have I got? Um... [A Magritte painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empire_of_Light) sold for USD121.1m, [Estonia legalised gay marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Estonia), literally every single company added AI to literally every single one of their products, and [I released my second album](https://clivemurray.bandcamp.com/album/love-and-painkillers). No, really, I did.

Those suddenly pining for the fjords included [David Soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Soul), [Franz Beckenbauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Beckenbauer), [Carl Weathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Weathers), [Steve Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wright_(DJ)), [TM Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._M._Stevens), [Peter Higgs (he of the boson)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Higgs), [OJ Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson), [Dickey Betts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey_Betts), [Bernard Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Hill), [Steve Albini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini), [Morgan Spurlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Spurlock), [Lynn Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Conway), [Donald Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland), [James Earl Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Earl_Jones), [Dame Maggie Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Smith), [Kris Kristofferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Kristofferson), [Paul Di'Anno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Di%27Anno), [Geoff Capes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Capes), [Janey Godley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janey_Godley), [Quincy Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Jones), [Vic Flick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Flick), [John Prescott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Prescott), [Bob Bryar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Bryar), [Eddie Stobart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Stobart), [my cat Bertie](/public/images/2025/05/bertie.jpg), and Matt Buckley.

That last name may not be familiar unless you were involved in the local music scene around Eastbourne/Hastings/Bexhill and that sort of area in the 1990s. Matt was the first person I ever saw playing an actual Ibanez Jem in real life, and of all of us he seemed to be the most likely to succeed. I believe he went to GIT (or it could have been a different music school, my memory is bad) in the USA, and was an absurdly gifted guitarist and musician. I was only ever in one band with him, and that only briefly – one of the lineups of *Iguanahead* had me on acoustic guitar and Matt on lead for about a month or two before he left leaving me to take over all guitar duties. Before that, I would occasionally get up on stage with *Sinister Footwear* and play "Surfing With the Alien" or something to give Matt a break to go and get a pint. He was always something of an oddball, and was never dull to be around. Things could always happen, and usually did. He was troubled though, and while I have no concrete details of his passing, I have heard from mutual friends that sadly he took his own life. RIP Matt.

Musically 2024 was a year of comebacks. All of these artists released a fantastic album in 2024 after 5 years away or more:

* *Underworld* – **Strawberry Hotel** – 5 years
* *Mr. Big* – **Ten** – 7 years
* *Linkin Park* – **From Zero** – 7 years
* *Alien Ant Farm* – **Mantras** – 9 years
* *Sebastian Bach* – **Child Within the Man** – 10 years
* *The Cure* – **Songs of a Lost World** – 16 years
* *Clive Murray* – **Love and Painkillers** – 22 years

So... you know. Don't write someone off when they're down, until their sleeping chickens are all in a row. Or something.

## The one-liners

- [*Sebastian Bach*](https://www.sebastianbach.com/) – [**Child Within the Man**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Child-WIthin-Man-Sebastian-Bach/dp/B0CY3BXR8N). (Rock.) The former *Skid Row* screamjouster returns after a ten-year hiatus with a hard rocking album, sprinkled with guest guitar spots from the likes of John 5, Orianthi and Steve Stevens. Not flawless, but very good.
- [*Jerry Cantrell*](https://www.jerrycantrell.com/) – [**I Want Blood**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/I-Want-Blood-Jerry-Cantrell/dp/B0DFCBVT27). (Rock.) Head plank-molester for *Alice in Chains*, Jerry brings us another solo outing. Sounds quite like *Alice in Chains*, as it goes.
- [*Frost\**](https://frost.life/) – [**Life in the Wires**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Wires-Frost/dp/B0DD6ZY7ZK). (Proggy rock. Or rocky prog, I suppose.) Messrs Godfrey, Mitchell, Blundell and King return with their fifth full-length long player. Cracking stuff.
- [*Intervals*](https://intrvls.com/) – [**Memory Palace**](https://intervalsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/memory-palace). (Instrumental metal.) Aaron Marshall with another tightly conceived block of instru-metal. As great as it is, they are all starting to sound pretty samey.
- [*Dua Lipa*](https://dualipa.com/) - [**Radical Optimism**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Radical-Optimism-Limited-Lenticular-CD/dp/B0CXDXW5LV). (Pop). I adored Ms. Lipa's previous album **Future Nostalgia**, and while there's nothing wrong with this one, it doesn't quite grab me the same way. "French Exit" is fab though.
- [*Rabea Massaad*](https://rabeamassaad.bandcamp.com) – [**Grinding Gears Vol. 4**](https://rabeamassaad.bandcamp.com/album/grinding-gears-vol-4). (Instrumental metal.) The fourth instalment of Rabea's gear demo tunes is the heaviest and best yet. Can the man do no wrong?
- [*Mr. Big*](https://www.mrbigsite.com/) - [**Ten**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ten-Mr-Big/dp/B0D2JFG16X). (Rock). If I'm honest, I only really care about the first three—maybe two—*Mr. Big* albums, but this here is their final one. So, there's that.
- [*Clive Murray*](https://clivemurray.com/) - [**Love and Painkillers**](https://clivemurray.bandcamp.com/album/love-and-painkillers). (Instrumental rock). Ahem. Yes. Look, it took me twenty years, and I finally finished it and released it. Sue me for being proud of that.
- [*Pet Shop Boys*](https://petshopboys.co.uk/) - [**Nonetheless**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/nonetheless-Deluxe-2CD-Shop-Boys/dp/B0CTKKBBVF). (Pop). Neil and Chris are still doing it, and they still sound great.
- [*dUg Pinnick*](https://www.dugnation.net/) - [**Thingamajigger**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thingamajigger-Dug-Pinnick/dp/B0DJ1HWVZH). (Rock). Chief bass-botherer off of *King's X* dUg brings us a solo record to tide us over until the next *KXM* album. It's fine.
- [*Taylor Swift*](https://www.taylorswift.com/) - [**The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tortured-Poets-Department-Anthology/dp/B0DNNG5RSM). (Pop). I like Taylor, and I don't care who knows it. Not as mesmerising as **Midnights**, not as intimate as **Folklore** or **Evermore**, and could probably stand to lose a couple of tracks. Still great though.
- [*Týr*](https://tyr.fo/) - [**Battle Ballads**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Battle-Ballads-T-r/dp/B0CV1CWZGD). (Folk Metal). The Faroese metallers are still going after a few lineup changes and their ninth album is exactly what you might expect. If you like them, you'll like this.
- [*Whom Gods Destroy*](https://wgdestroy.com/) - [**Insanium**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Insanium-Whom-Gods-Destroy/dp/B0CPB3G8NH). (Prog Metal). I wanted this to be as good as *Sons of Apollo*, but it's not quite. Nothing wrong with it though, and if you like Sherinian or Thal you'll love it. Dino Jelusick (vocals) is one to watch for sure.
