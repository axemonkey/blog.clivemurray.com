2024 was a year. I expect *some* good things happened, but in the main it was not zesty.

Many major armed conflicts continued in many places including [Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine), [Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_civil_war_(2021%E2%80%93present)), [Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_civil_war_(2023%E2%80%93present)), [the Sahel region of West Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamist_insurgency_in_the_Sahel) and [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war), as well as [the ongoing war in Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war). Sweden joined NATO and Bulgaria and Romania joined [Schengen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area). [Northern America saw a total solar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_April_8,_2024), and [a G5-rated series of solar storms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2024_solar_storms) led to the aurorae (both Borealis and Australis) to be seen much further from the poles than usual, including right over my back garden in Hemel Hempstead. FACT. P45 was [found guilty on 34 counts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_in_New_York), and we thought that would be the last we'd see of him. Hah. Then someone [shot him in the ear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Pennsylvania). [CrowdStrike knackered up a lot of Windows computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike_incident), the knock-on effects bringing down airlines, banks, government services and more across the world. This also made it difficult for punters to buy beer at [the festival I was playing](https://hoodstock.rocks) that day, so boo. In an unusually positive move, the UK became the first G7 country to [phase out coal power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_phase-out). The [Europa Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Clipper) was sent to Europa, Jupiter's moon. (Hopefully **not** to [attempt a landing](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/992255-all-these-worlds-are-yours-except-europa-attempt-no-landing).) The UK got its first Labour government[^starmer] since 2005, P45 got re-elected[^trump], and many countries around the world tilted further and further to the political right, about which I am **very much not OK**. I try to keep politics out of these intros, but damn, it's hard. Alright what else have I got? Um... [A Magritte painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empire_of_Light) sold for USD121.1m, [Estonia legalised gay marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Estonia), literally every single company added AI to literally every single one of their products, and [I released my second album](https://clivemurray.bandcamp.com/album/love-and-painkillers). No, really, I did.

Those suddenly pining for the fjords included [David Soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Soul), [Franz Beckenbauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Beckenbauer), [Carl Weathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Weathers), [Steve Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wright_(DJ)), [TM Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._M._Stevens), [Peter Higgs (he of the boson)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Higgs), [OJ Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson), [Dickey Betts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey_Betts), [Bernard Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Hill), [Steve Albini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini), [Morgan Spurlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Spurlock), [Lynn Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Conway), [Donald Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland), [James Earl Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Earl_Jones), [Dame Maggie Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Smith), [Kris Kristofferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Kristofferson), [Paul Di'Anno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Di%27Anno), [Geoff Capes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Capes), [Janey Godley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janey_Godley), [Quincy Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Jones), [Vic Flick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Flick), [John Prescott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Prescott), [Bob Bryar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Bryar), [Eddie Stobart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Stobart), [my cat Bertie](/public/images/2025/05/bertie.jpg), and Matt Buckley.

That last name may not be familiar unless you were involved in the local music scene around Eastbourne/Hastings/Bexhill and that sort of area in the 1990s. Matt was the first person I ever saw playing an actual Ibanez Jem in real life, and of all of us he seemed to be the most likely to succeed. I believe he went to GIT (or it could have been a different music school, my memory is bad) in the USA, and was an absurdly gifted guitarist and musician. I was only ever in one band with him, and that only briefly – one of the lineups of *Iguanahead* had me on acoustic guitar and Matt on lead for about a month or two before he left leaving me to take over all guitar duties. Before that, I would occasionally get up on stage with *Sinister Footwear* and play "Surfing With the Alien" or something to give Matt a break to go and get a pint. He was always something of an oddball, and was never dull to be around. Things could always happen, and usually did. He was troubled though, and while I have no concrete details of his passing, I have heard from mutual friends that sadly he took his own life. RIP Matt.

Musically 2024 was a year of comebacks. All of these artists released a fantastic album in 2024 after a 5+ year hiatus:

* *Underworld* – **Strawberry Hotel** – 5 years
* *Mr. Big* – **Ten** – 7 years
* *Linkin Park* – **From Zero** – 7 years
* *Alien Ant Farm* – **Mantras** – 9 years
* *Sebastian Bach* – **Child Within the Man** – 10 years
* *The Cure* – **Songs of a Lost World** – 16 years
* *Clive Murray* – **Love and Painkillers** – 22 years

So... you know. Don't write someone off when they're down until their sleeping chickens are all in a row, with two in a bush. Or something.

## The one-liners

- [*Sebastian Bach*](https://www.sebastianbach.com/) – [**Child Within the Man**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Child-WIthin-Man-Sebastian-Bach/dp/B0CY3BXR8N). (Rock.) The former *Skid Row* screamjouster returns after a ten-year break with a hard rocking album, sprinkled with guest guitar spots from the likes of John 5, Orianthi and Steve Stevens. Not flawless, but very good.
- [*Jerry Cantrell*](https://www.jerrycantrell.com/) – [**I Want Blood**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/I-Want-Blood-Jerry-Cantrell/dp/B0DFCBVT27). (Rock.) Head plank-molester for *Alice in Chains*, Jerry brings us another solo outing. Sounds quite like *Alice in Chains*, as it goes.
- [*Frost\**](https://frost.life/) – [**Life in the Wires**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Wires-Frost/dp/B0DD6ZY7ZK). (Proggy rock. Or rocky prog, I suppose.) Messrs Godfrey, Mitchell, Blundell and King return with their fifth full-length long player. Cracking stuff.
- [*Intervals*](https://intrvls.com/) – [**Memory Palace**](https://intervalsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/memory-palace). (Instrumental metal.) Aaron Marshall with another tightly conceived block of instru-metal. As great as it is, they are all starting to sound a bit samey.
- [*Dua Lipa*](https://dualipa.com/) - [**Radical Optimism**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Radical-Optimism-Limited-Lenticular-CD/dp/B0CXDXW5LV). (Pop). I adored Ms. Lipa's previous album **Future Nostalgia**, and while there's nothing wrong with this one, it doesn't quite grab me the same way. "French Exit" is fab though.
- [*Rabea Massaad*](https://rabeamassaad.bandcamp.com) – [**Grinding Gears Vol. 4**](https://rabeamassaad.bandcamp.com/album/grinding-gears-vol-4). (Instrumental metal.) The fourth instalment of Rabea's gear demo tunes is the heaviest and best yet. Can the man do no wrong?
- [*Mr. Big*](https://www.mrbigsite.com/) - [**Ten**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ten-Mr-Big/dp/B0D2JFG16X). (Rock). If I'm honest, I only really care about the first three—maybe two—*Mr. Big* albums, but this here is their final one. So, there's that.
- [*Clive Murray*](https://clivemurray.com/) - [**Love and Painkillers**](https://clivemurray.bandcamp.com/album/love-and-painkillers). (Instrumental rock). Ahem. Yes. Look, it took me twenty years, and I finally finished it and released it. Sue me for being proud of that.
- [*Pet Shop Boys*](https://petshopboys.co.uk/) - [**Nonetheless**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/nonetheless-Deluxe-2CD-Shop-Boys/dp/B0CTKKBBVF). (Pop). Neil and Chris are still doing it, and they still sound great.
- [*dUg Pinnick*](https://www.dugnation.net/) - [**Thingamajigger**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thingamajigger-Dug-Pinnick/dp/B0DJ1HWVZH). (Rock). Chief bass-botherer off of *King's X* dUg brings us a solo record to tide us over until the next *KXM* album. It's fine.
- [*Taylor Swift*](https://www.taylorswift.com/) - [**The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tortured-Poets-Department-Anthology/dp/B0DNNG5RSM). (Pop). I like Taylor, and I don't care who knows it. Not as mesmerising as **Midnights**, not as intimate as **Folklore** or **Evermore**, and could probably stand to lose a couple of tracks. Still great though.
- [*Týr*](https://tyr.fo/) - [**Battle Ballads**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Battle-Ballads-T-r/dp/B0CV1CWZGD). (Folk Metal). The Faroese metallers are still going after a few lineup changes and their ninth album is exactly what you might expect. If you like them, you'll like this.
- [*Whom Gods Destroy*](https://wgdestroy.com/) - [**Insanium**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Insanium-Whom-Gods-Destroy/dp/B0CPB3G8NH). (Prog Metal). I wanted this to be as good as *Sons of Apollo*, but it's not quite. Nothing wrong with it though, and if you like Sherinian or Thal you'll love it. Dino Jelusick (vocals) is one to watch for sure.

## Honourable mentions

### [Alien Ant Farm](https://alienantfarm.com/) - [Mantras](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mantras-VINYL-Alien-Ant-Farm/dp/B0CSKGCJHT)

![Alien Ant Farm – Mantras](/public/images/2025/05/aaf-m.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention loading=lazy} Probably like a lot of people, I first became aware of *AAF* in 2001 when their major label debut **ANThology** dropped , bringing with it their smash cover of Jacko's "Smooth Criminal". You remember? [The video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE){title="Link to the video for Smooth Criminal by Alien Ant Farm"} was ace, and they did the leaning over thing like Mike? Yeah? Good times.

Well, actually [the times from a musical POV were pretty dark](/the-dark-times) for me, but I really liked that album. Anyhow, I lost touch with what they were up to after the less notable followup **TruANT**, and only checked back in on Dryden and co. when I heard they had a new album out, but this one is top drawer gear. Now that nu-metal is thankfully a distant memory, the band's sound has matured and broadened while still being recongiseable as the same band. The first three tracks are brilliant, and "Last dAntz" particularly stands out as a nod to *Coheed and Cambria* with even shades of *Polyphia* creeping in. The album doesn't lose steam there either, and in tru-ANT style we even get a *Wham!* cover, "Everything She wAnts". Great work, boys. **Top track:** "[Last dAntz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G_yA1mAhIk)"

### [Billie Eilish](http://billieeilish.com/) - [Hit Me Hard and Soft](https://www.amazon.co.uk/HIT-HARD-SOFT-Billie-Eilish/dp/B0CZWKXLQ3)

![Billie Eilish – Hit Me Hard and Soft](/public/images/2025/05/be-hmhas.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention loading=lazy} Billie was born in the year **ANThology** came out. So, there's that. She's young, is what I'm saying. And yet there's a maturity and depth in her voice that I find bewitching, and when coupled with the playful "edginess" of her lyrics and musical stylings, the results are some of the best pop songs around. She's a proper musician too. She writes in collaboration with her brother Finneas, who is also her producer, but you don't become [the youngest artist ever to sing a James Bond theme song](https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicamercuri/2020/01/14/billie-eilish-makes-history-as-youngest-artist-to-sing-james-bond-theme-song/) without being the real deal. Great. **Top track:** "[Lunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB3VkzPdgLA)"

### [Elbow](https://elbow.co.uk/) - [Audio Vertigo](https://www.amazon.co.uk/AUDIO-VERTIGO-Elbow/dp/B0CSM2W9TT)

![Elbow – Audio Vertigo](/public/images/2025/05/e-av.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention loading=lazy} I've opined before about how much I've loved *Elbow* since hearing **Cast of Thousands** back in the early 2000s and they remain one of my favourite British bands. Guy Garvey's raw poetic sincerity bleeds through the band's tight arrangements, which swing from sparse to lush with ease. If you can listen to this album and feel nothing, you might have died. Check, would you? **Top track:** "[Balu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0zYKdfu6Zo)"

### [Green Day](https://greenday.com/) - [Saviors](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Saviors-Green-Day/dp/B0CL7V2LHJ)

![Green Day Saviors](/public/images/2025/05/gd-s.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention loading=lazy} Look, you know what you're going to get with *Green Day*, right? Right. And that's what you get. And it's really great. Any questions? **Top track:** "[Corvette Summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KseB903DZao)"

### [Gun](https://www.gunofficial.co.uk/) - [Hombres](https://gunofficialuk.bandcamp.com/album/hombres)

![Gun – Hombres](/public/images/2025/05/g-h.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention loading=lazy} I don't know how big Scot-rockers *Gun* ever were outside the UK, and even here they were mostly known for their smash cover of *Cameo*'s "[Word Up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_Up!_(song))" (which still owns). Well, they've had the usual inevitable line-up changes and a 15-year break, but the current line-up seems stable and this is a cracking rock album. Lead single "All Fired Up" is a block-rocker, and "Falling" is just lovely. Nice one. **Top track:** "[Falling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIEwHajet18)"

### [London Grammar](https://www.londongrammar.com/) - [The Greatest Love](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Greatest-Love-London-Grammar/dp/B0CZW1LGXQ)

![London Grammar – The Greatest Love](/public/images/2025/05/lg-tgl.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention loading=lazy} I love *London Grammar*. Ethereal moody indie-pop, I suppose, but what do I know? Beautiful vocals, pretty songs, what's not to like? **Top track:** "[House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBVr0GgDfi4)"

### [The Offspring](http://offspring.com/) - [Supercharged](https://www.amazon.co.uk/SUPERCHARGED-Offspring/dp/B0D5ZBNJ5T)

![The Offspring – Supercharged](/public/images/2025/05/to-s.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention loading=lazy} Again, you know what you're going to get with *The Offspring*, and you get it, and it is good. 33 minutes of fun punky rock tracks. Any questions? **Top track:** "[Looking Out For #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kred-O48M6w)"

### [Max Richter](https://www.maxrichtermusic.com/) - [In a Landscape](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Landscape-Max-Richter/dp/B0D51P46PZ)

![Max Richter – In a Landscape](/public/images/2025/05/mr-ial.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention loading=lazy} Lorem. **Top track:** "[They Will Shade Us With Their Wings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU7yntVN30A)"

### [Devin Townsend](https://hevydevy.com/) - [PowerNerd](https://www.amazon.co.uk/PowerNerd-Devin-Townsend/dp/B0DDZLDJDV)

![Devin Townsend – PowerNerd](/public/images/2025/05/dt-p.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention loading=lazy} Lorem. **Top track:** "[Gratitude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mnjfXmsEUQ)"

### [Underworld](https://underworldlive.com/) - [Strawberry Hotel](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Strawberry-Hotel-Underworld/dp/B0DC21PX75)

![Underworld – Strawberry Hotel](/public/images/2025/05/u-sh.jpg){.aoty .aoty-mention loading=lazy} Lorem. **Top track:** "xxx"

## And the winners are…

I've gone back and forth on this a few times, and while the first one was never in any doubt, the second took a while to lock down its place on top of the podium.
