excerpt: It's another tie for 1995. I just couldn't separate what are for me still to this day two perfect albums that have barely dated in two decades.

In 1995 I reached legal USA drinking age, [ST:Voyager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Voyager) started, [Richey Edwards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richey_Edwards) disappeared, [Kevin Mitnick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick) was arrested, [Nick Leeson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Leeson) collapsed an entire banking firm, [Yahoo!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Search), [sarin gas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarin_gas_attack_on_the_Tokyo_subway), the [Oklahoma bombing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing), [Windows 95](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95), the [DVD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD), [eBay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay), and [OJ Simpson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson) was acquitted.

Bon voyage was bid to (as always, etc.) [Larry Grayson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Grayson), [Peter Cook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cook), [Gerald Durrell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Durrell), [Donald Pleasance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Pleasence), [Vivian Stanshall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_Stanshall), [Ronnie Kray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kray_twins), [Kenny Everett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Everett), [Ginger Rogers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Rogers), [Rory Gallagher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Gallagher), [Jerry Garcia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia), [Sherlock Holmes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Brett), [Paul Eddington](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Eddington) and [Dino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Martin).

## Honourable mentions

### [Faith No More](http://www.fnm.com/) - [King For a Day… Fool For a Lifetime](http://www.amazon.co.uk/King-Day-Faith-No-More/dp/B000024HFL/)

When my mate Justin came round with this album, I had no idea what to make of it. It's about 50% what I expected from *FNM*, about 10% unlistenable screaming that sounded like *Mr. Bungle* having a bad day, and the rest… weird lounge crooning. Fascinating for the most part. **Top track:** "The Gentle Art of Making Enemies"

### [Garbage](http://www.garbage.com/) - [Garbage](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Garbage/dp/B000005ROC/)

I think I first saw *Garbage* live on TFI Friday back in the day, and while I liked what I heard well enough, it was years later I went back and really appreciated their catalogue. Superbly crafted songs. **Top track:** "Stupid Girl"

### [The Presidents of the USA](http://www.presidentsrock.com/) - [The Presidents of the USA](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Presidents-United-States-America/dp/B000024JDX/)

*PUSA!* If you don't know then I can't tell you, etc., but here is where it all started. Worth the price of admission for "Lump" alone, obviously. **Top track:** "Body"

### [Steve Vai](http://www.vai.com/) - [Alien Love Secrets](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Alien-Love-Secrets-Steve-Vai/dp/B000025TBT/)

This 7-track EP benefits hugely from Mr. Vai keeping his gob shut, and aside from the truly unlistenable "Ya-Yo Gakk", everything else here is absolutely top-drawer Vai. **Top track:** "Tender Surrender"

## And the winners are…

It's another tie for 1995. I just couldn't separate what are for me still to this day two perfect albums that have barely dated in two decades.

### [Pulp](http://www.pulppeople.com/) - [Different Class](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Different-Class-Pulp/dp/B000001E8P/)

![Pulp - Different Class](/public/images/2018/03/51lBaKp46rL.jpg)

Brit-pop and me didn't really get along for the most part, but this album is absolute perfection from start to finish. There's not a bad moment on it, from the anthemic "Mis-Shapes", the visceral "Pencil Skirt" and the outright venomous "I Spy" to the floor filling classics "Common People" and "Disco 2000" there's not a note out of place.

It's somehow of its time but also timeless. Honestly, go and put it on now. It could have been released this year.

Bloody wonderful stuff.

**Top tracks:** "Pencil Skirt", "I Spy", "Underwear"

### [Radiohead](http://www.radiohead.co.uk/) - [The Bends](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bends-Radiohead/dp/B000002TQV/)

![Radiohead - The Bends](/public/images/2018/03/cover_1813327122010.jpg)

I'm aware that I'm in the minority in thinking that *Radiohead* peaked here and everything they did after **OK Computer** was frankly dirge, but can we perhaps agree that when this album came out it was absolutely gobsmacking?

It was. And it still is.

**Top tracks:** "High and Dry", "The Bends", "Fake Plastic Trees"

## Turkey of the Year

It's actually hard to pick, there were so many misfires this year - the [Dark Times](/the-dark-times/) had really set in. But for pure disappointment value I'm going for…

### [Extreme](http://www.extreme-band.com/) - [Waiting For the Punchline](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Waiting-Punchline-Extreme/dp/B000024GFT/)

Oof. No. Awful.
