Small point of order – I have retroactively changed [Clive’s Album of the Year 2011](/clives-album-of-the-year-2011/).

The more time went by, the less **Steel Panther** felt like a good fit, so they're out. I still like them, but the joke has worn thin now, and it just doesn't feel very... woke, as I believe people say these days.

So sorry to **Steel Panther**, and congrats to **You Me At Six** on the upgrade.

If you cared.
