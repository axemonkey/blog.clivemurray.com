Further adventures in cubing!

Here we see our hero solving the [Supernova WuQue 4x4 M](https://speedcubeshop.com/collections/supernova-magnetic/products/supernova-wuque-m-4x4) in a pretty poor time of 5:00. I've sped the solve up by 500% so you don't have to sit watching me fumble about for five minutes. One day I'll learn a method that's quicker than the beginner method, but I haven't yet.
