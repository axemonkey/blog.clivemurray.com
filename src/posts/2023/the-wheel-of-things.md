**TL;DR**

I made a new thing! It is [The Wheel of Things](https://wot.clivemurray.com/). You might like it.

**Longer version**

In my house, we like table-top games. I didn’t say “board games” because many of them employ cards but no board, so “table-top games” it is. Also, this reminds me of the splendid Wil Wheaton YouTube series called [TableTop](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7atuZxmT956cWFGxqSyRdn6GWhBxiAwE) whence I learned of some of these games. It’s great fun, go watch some episodes.

Anyway, in a bid to get my son to unstick his face from screens, we began amassing a collection of table-top games which would enable us to spend Quality Time away from digital devices and have a bunch of fun. Friends turned us onto [Munchkin](https://munchkin.game/), [Boss Monster](https://www.brotherwisegames.com/bossmonster) and [Escape the Dark Castle](https://themeborne.com/products/escape-the-dark-castle), and from there we expanded our collection with things like [Forbidden Island](https://gamewright.com/product/Forbidden-Island), [Unearth](https://www.brotherwisegames.com/unearth/), [Doomlings](https://doomlings.com/) and [Star Fluxx](https://www.looneylabs.com/games/star-fluxx).

We bought expansions for some of them, we got more, and soon the biggest issue we had on a Saturday morning was deciding which table-top game to play. Well, being a website-making kinda guy, I quipped “Maybe I’ll make a wheel-of-fortune type website so we can easily pick one at random…”

Which of course, I then did. Once I’d built it, I figured “Hmmm… I wonder if this might be of use to anyone else… maybe if you could choose your own things to put on the wheel… hmmm…”

So of course, I built that. It is [The Wheel of Things](https://wot.clivemurray.com/), and you are most welcome to use it. If it doesn’t work for you on your computer/device, or if you have other comments on it, you can drop me a line via [email](mailto:hi@clivemurray.com) or [Mastodon](https://metalhead.club/@axemonkey).

However, I accept **no responsibility** for anything that occurs as a result of you using the Wheel of Things. That is on **you**.
