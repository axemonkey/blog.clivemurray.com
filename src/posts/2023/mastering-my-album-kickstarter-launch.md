Hello.

I've been working on my second solo album of guitar instrumentals on-and-off for well over a decade now. I am very happy to report that I am *nearly* there.

All my guitar parts are recorded, drums bass and keyboards are done, and I am just waiting for a few guest collaborators to send me their parts and then I can finish mixing it.

The last step will be to get it mastered, and sadly due to financial constraints, the whole project could fall at the final hurdle.

To try and prevent this, I have launched a Kickstarter to help me achieve the last step.

[I would be extremely if you would visit it, watch the short video, and maybe even pop a little pledge in, if you can.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/axemonkey/mastering-my-album-love-and-painkillers)

Thank you. 🙏
