## H is for… [Daniel Hope](https://www.danielhope.com/)

Once again, it's not all rock and metal round here at Murray Mansions. One of my favourite modern composers is the splendid [*Max Richter*](https://www.maxrichter.com/), and it was at one of his concerts I discovered this rather good violinist, viz Daniel Hope. He played up a storm on Max's stuff, and later on I discovered a couple of rather good albums of his. I'm no classical buff by any stretch of the imagination, but one thing I do like is some well-played violin, and that's what you get from Daniel.

## Clive recommends:

Daniel's work with [*Max Richter*](https://www.maxrichter.com/) is outstanding, particularly "[**Recomposed by Max Richter: Vivaldi – The Four Seasons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recomposed_by_Max_Richter:_Vivaldi_%E2%80%93_The_Four_Seasons)", but his own albums are also wonderful and sport a nice variety of material. I'd go for his 2013 release "[**Spheres**](https://www.danielhope.com/listento/spheres/)" where he gives his spin to various pieces from modern classicists like Richter, Einaudi, Glass and Pärt as well as more traditional pieces by Prokofiev, Bach et al.

## Video evidence

Here's Daniel smashing out a classic Vivaldi banger, Winter pt.1 (allegro non molto) from (natch) The Four Seasons.

Respect.
