...your call is important to us.

But we are going through a number of things at the moment, and honestly haven't felt capable of blogging for a while.

It's OK to not be OK, and frankly, I'm not. But, I have people around me who love me and help me and support me, and I'm slowly putting the broken pieces back together, bit by bit.

We'll be back, we're sure. We've been doing this since before the word "blogging" was coined, after all. And there will be ranting, and music, and rubik's cubes, and all the other stuff.

Just give me a little bit longer, that's all I ask.

In the meantime, here is a picture of some cats.
