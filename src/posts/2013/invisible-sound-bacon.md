My good friend Nick Beatty, known on the Twitters as [@bumlaser](http://www.twitter.com/bumlaser), has a unique way with words.

If you like words, and things that are funny, you should follow him.

Additionally, he has written a thing for Seymour Duncan regarding multi-amp guitar rigs, and you should read it - even if you don't care about the subject, it's still highly amusing yet informative at the same time.

Go on - it's [here](http://www.seymourduncan.com/blog/the-tone-garage/multi-amp-rigs-101/).
