I'm Clive. Rock guitarist and gentleman adventurer from a land before time. I am also at [clivemurray.com](https://clivemurray.com/).

I'm a web developer by day, currently working at [Springer Nature](https://www.springernature.com/) and rock guitarist by night. My band is [Indigo Down](http://indigodown.com/).

I released a [solo instrumental album called "Earthman"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Earthman-Clive-Murray/dp/B002EKDYDE/) in 2002, and have been working on the follow-up since then. [I made a site to show how that's going](https://loveandpainkillers.com/).

I live in Hemel Hempstead with my family and cats.

This blog lives on a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) in my house, and is powered by [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).

You can email me on [hi@clivemurray.com](mailto:hi@clivemurray.com) if the desire so takes you.

I used to Twitter as [@axemonkey](https://www.twitter.com/axemonkey), but Elongated Muskrat ruined all that. (I still maintain my account, but don't post there any more. If you really need to get hold of my via Twitter, I might still get it.)

But now I am on a splendid instance of Mastodon instead, so feel free to toot me at [@axemonkey@metalhead.club](https://metalhead.club/@axemonkey).
