I’m Clive. Rock guitarist and gentleman adventurer from a land before time. I am also at [clivemurray.com](https://clivemurray.com/).

I’m a web developer by day, currently working at a wonderful publishing company, and rock guitarist by night. My band is [Indigo Down](http://indigodown.com/).

In 2024 I finally finished and released [my second solo album, "Love and Painkillers"](https://clivemurray.bandcamp.com/album/love-and-painkillers), of which I am extremely proud. It isn’t perfect, but it is as good as I could make it, and took me a very long time. [My first album ("Earthman", 2002)](https://clivemurray.bandcamp.com/album/earthman) is also still available.

I also make little web tools and toys. Feel free to have a play with:

* [Flipper](https://flipper.clivemurray.com/)
* [The Wheel of Things](https://wot.clivemurray.com/)
* [Project Codename Generator](https://codenames.clivemurray.com/)
* [Cubist – a speedcubing timer](https://cubi.st/) (not quite finished)
* [Print a month](https://calendar.clivemurray.com/) (not finished)

This blog used to live on a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) in my house, and used to be powered by [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). Since June 2023 however, this site now lives on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is powered by the mighty [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). Hurrah! It also used to live at **[insince.re](https://insince.re)**, but [because of Brexit, it now doesn’t](/moving-house). Booo!

You can email me on [hi@clivemurray.com](mailto:hi@clivemurray.com) if the desire so takes you.

I used to Twitter as [@axemonkey](https://www.twitter.com/axemonkey), but Elongated Muskrat ruined all that. (I still maintain my account, but don’t post there any more. If you really need to get hold of me via Twitter, I might still get it.)

But now I am on a splendid instance of Mastodon instead, so [feel free to toot me at @axemonkey@metalhead.club](https://metalhead.club/@axemonkey).

[I have also recently joined BlueSky, so you can also get me there](https://bsky.app/profile/axemonkey.bsky.social).

I live in Hemel Hempstead with my family and cats.
