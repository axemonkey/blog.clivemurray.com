When I started this blog on my little Raspberry Pi, I wanted something that would keep me coming back to write. I knew from experience that just blogging for the sake of it would soon peter out, and the whole thing would just wither and die.

So I came up with the idea of [Clive’s Album of the Year](/tag/albums-of-the-years/). I’d start at the current year (2013 at the time) and work backwards to the year of my birth (1974) picking out my favourite album(s) of that year and writing a little about it/them. Well, I finally got all the way back to 1974 (and also filled in the years that elapsed while doing so) so here for reference are the winners and runners-up for every year of my life so far.

You can of course click through to the posts if you want to read more.

Enjoy.
