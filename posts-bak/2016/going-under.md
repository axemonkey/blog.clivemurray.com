This blog will be going offline for a little while shortly, as I'm moving house.

The blog runs off a Raspberry Pi in my house, and since the new house won't have internet for a good week or so after the move, it will be perforce offline (and probably in a box).

Which means that you won't be able to read this. If you can, then i) I haven't moved yet, or ii) I haven't got internet in the new house yet.

Should be back online early-to-mid-December.

As you were.
