Many years ago, I came up with an excellent name for a cocktail â€“ the "Gin Diesel". However it was at least a full year before I could properly nail down the recipe.

It must contain gin, natch, but also something dark and strong to represent the diesel element, while still remaining drinkable.

The end result is *very* drinkable, and is the official cocktail of [Indigo Down](http://indigodown.com/).

It's a cracking Summer drink, somewhere between a Moscow Mule and a Dark & Stormy. Want to try one? OK, here you go:

- 2 measures (50ml) gin (nothing too floral, Tanqueray is perfect)
- 1 measure (25ml) dark rum (ideally not spiced or gold... Lamb's Navy is spot on)
- 1 measure (25ml) lime juice
- pour over ice into a highball or tumbler
- top up with ginger beer (Old Jamaica is ðŸ‘Œ)

Lob in a mint leaf or a strawberry if that's your kind of thing. I don't, because I'm not a monster.
