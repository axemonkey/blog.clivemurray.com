So, I lost all my posts from Christmas onwards.

![Crash!](http://www.carinsurancecomparison.com/Images/car-crash.jpg)

The Raspberry Pi that hosts this blog crashed and bombed **hard** and the SD card got corrupted. No amount of FSCKing or other tricks would let me get any files off the thing - I only managed to get into the file system once, and by that point all networking had failed, so even though I could see the ghost.db file, I could do nothing with it - and so I had to reformat and start again.

Luckily, it seems that some time over Christmas I was footling around with Ghost and discovered its export option, and saved a GhostData.json file into Dropbox.

So... we've lost Album of the Year 2010, the huge long rambling post about guitars and the 7-string I ordered, and probably not that much else really, when you get right down to it.

I shall treat this as an object lesson in backing up.
