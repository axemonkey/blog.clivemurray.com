So I mentioned in the last post that I had learned my lesson re backing up - so it was time to actually do something about it.

Well, with a little help from [Dropbox Uploader](https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader) and a sprinkle of crontab magic, I am now backing up my Ghost.db file once a day.

Hopefully now even if the Pi explodes in a shower of magic pixie dust I should be able to rebuild and resurrect this blog with all (or near as dammit) content intact.
